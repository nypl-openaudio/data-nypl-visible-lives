## The Collection Description
[Visible Lives: Oral Histories of the Disability Experience](http://oralhistory.nypl.org/neighborhoods/visible-lives) is an oral history project by [The New York Public Library Community Oral History Project](http://oralhistory.nypl.org/) that works to both preserve and document a thematic history through personal recollections. This project will collect stories of people who are living with a disability and the Library will train community members to conduct these interviews.
