Virginia Amato.

disorder and some people
don't understand what that is. But me I hear
voices. I see things that normal people
don't see and

Me, myself, and I that's who I decided to be.
I want you to finish this sentence for me. I draw my strength from ___

be another person probably locked away in an insane asylum somewhere
just being mistreated because of a disability that people don't understand
Thank you, Virginia, your story is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you
