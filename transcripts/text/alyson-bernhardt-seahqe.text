And you know
hopefully, help other people become aware of
You know the symptoms, and what you can do to prevent it or, while you're
having the stroke. What, you know, what exactly
causes it, what what happens in the body physically?
Well.
Migraines. Yes.
I get migraines 
little. All
through my life. So I
didn't get that. But migraines.
I think.
Migraines. So you suffer
suffered through migraines? Friday,
Two years ago on Friday I was feeling icky
Icky.
But migraines. And you had a migraine?

You know. So you have a lot of help.
That's good. Did you, when you were in the hospital, did you
Did you ever feel like you're going to die
die from now? No. You weren't afraid or
scared of that? No. 
I asked that
because it's um, you know everyone's
stroke is different and their experiences
are different. I know someone had a really bad experience in
the
hospital. And I'm glad that you answered so emphatically
"No!" You sound really like you were really
are really brave and really strong and still
today. I'm inspired
by you. Thank you.
know. You know. I played over and over my head what you
said before,You can do everything you can do anything
it just takes a little more time.
And just a little more slowly. Yeah.
How
do you, can you remember a
time when your stroke
Really affected you but you were
determined not to let it get the best of you? 
And it seems like all the time you don't let it um, you know
You know,overpower you. But is there one specific instance
instance that you can think of, and if not that's okay.
hey that's good if you can't think of something.
Well. I was
frustrated
with the word finding
finding
and how is that for you today? Are
you able to find the
words? Uh
a little bit. Little bit. And you're still working on it?
Working on that. Yea.
You'll get there someday. Thank you.
yes. Is there any
anything that you want to share that I
haven't covered. Anything you'd like to let the
community you know about stroke awareness?
or
any any
particular challenges that you
faced?
So I guess kind of wraps things up.
up here. You were very helpful. Thank you. Very very inspiring.
I think it's again, it's so great that you're able to
work with what you have and you feel you're just so brave
and you're like a role model. Aw, thank you.
So I want to thank you again for sharing your
experience. And that's about it, so thank you
you. Thank
you.
