00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm here. This is Diane Campione and I'm here at the G.C.C. interview for visible lives with

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Amy Foxon.Hi Amy, Hi how are you? Who are you speaking about today?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We're speaking about my son Jason Foxman. He's four years old and was

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
diagnosed PDD-NOS at eighteen months-uh twenty one months I'm

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
sorry.  Can you tell me what made you suspect that he was different?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
He- And at what age? -twenty one months. 'Bout nineteen-twenty months I started

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 he wasn't walking. Crawling was very difficult

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
difficult for him. He would just glide. On the furniture

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
No. Was not verbal no eye

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
contact. You could call his name a hundred times and it would be no

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
response. Um. He wasn't eating

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
the way he should be.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And I started to get worried and I got him a, I went for a, a hearing

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
test to make sure that it wasn't. That he wasn't deaf.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and they said his hearing was fine and that somebody recommended that we should be

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Um, evaluated. So I took him to be

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
evaluated and they evaluated him as a PDD-NOS. And

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
we started home care for six months. And then

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
little by little I saw tiny changes but nothing substantial. And

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
then we enrolled him in Thursday's Child. And

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
a light bulb went off. And before you know it between

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
he would go to Thursday's Child in the morning and have home care 'til 6 o'clock at night. [door slam] 5 days a 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
week.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Between the two combined, what, there was a

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
huge, huge change. Huge change. He started to talk.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
He finally said Mommy at 23, just around his

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
second birthday. He started to say mommy. But it would

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
come and go in phases.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
There would be a phase where he would start to say little words...mommy and hi

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
bye, and no, and then it would stop.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And then nothing. And then it would start again. And he would

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
look at you, but you could see that he didn't know who you were.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And then the more, we went on and we went on and we went on

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
...

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
He just started to evolve.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And now, today, he's at 373 and 58, he's four

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
years old.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And I have a completely different child. Can you tell me

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
about the emotions? The day, your emotions, the day he was diagnosed?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
...

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I was distraught. One, because I didn't know. I didn't

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
know who he, what it was. And all I heard was autism.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Autism spectrum. Autism, autism. And I said

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I, I said this can't be. This, this

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
This can't be. Autism doesn't run in my family and I don't know anybody who is autistic at that

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
time.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And. It was it was very overwhelming. But you can't

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
show it. I couldn't show it because I didn't want, if there were any signs my

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
son was picking up. Everything had to be happy and positive and.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I'd cry in the shower, I'd cry at

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
night when everybody was asleep or I would just sit and think and it

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
was a lot to take in because I didn't know anything at that time

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
...

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
What would you say the best word, or wh-, what word best describes

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
difficult stages of his disability?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
The most difficult stages of his disability?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
... uh,um.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
It's rough. It's rough.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
When we first started and he wasn't responding and he wasn't. It was all so

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
new to him. He didn't want any part of it. It was heartbreaking.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Because he couldn't communicate to anybody or tell us,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Tell us what he wanted.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And uh. He's my first child, he's my only child. And

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
. It was just, it was heartbreaking

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
. What would you say was the biggest obstacle you've had to overcome?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
To hear that he's on the spectrum. For me.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
. For me.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
um. People who see him now would never

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
believe me when I tell them that he's on the spectrum. But

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I don't want to make this sound

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
To.. 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
To have that label. Be as honest as you like, if that's your feeling.  To be that, to have that

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
label. I don't know if it'll, if it'll be with him

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
. But the rest of his life because they had told me that, if he gets

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
transitioned into a regular kindergarten, all this will come off his record.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So I don't know but. I don't want him to feel different. I don't want him to feel

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I want him to be a regular kid.  I want him to be a

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
regular kid. He still has his delays. He's still delayed in potty training. He doesn't

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
sleep in his own bed. He... always

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
thinks. He thinks too much. He'll speak and then he thinks,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
he thinks too much. And you can see the wheels turning

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and he doesn't know how to express what he wants. Sometimes.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And he throws tantrums. I don't know which of it is typical four year old

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and which is part of his disability. But just to know

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
that he has. Or. That I'm talking about my son with a

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
disability. Yes, say it. It, it irks me.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Do you ever feel you gave up your life to give him a life? No. Well,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Well. There are a lot of things I don't do anymore.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
. Yeah, I don't see a lot of friends anymore. I don't.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
My husband I don't have a lot of, quiet time together

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
or date night or, or anything like that. Everything is, we're

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
all about, Jason. Twenty four - seven. It's Jason.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
. Do you ever ask why? I did.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
...And

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
In the beginning. I did.  But there was no answer why.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
It is what it is. Is there something you would like the public to know about

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
individuals such as yourself that have a child

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Within the spectrum?  Hang in there. Hang in there and be strong.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
If you need to cry, the shower is the best place to do it.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
But, you will, there is a light at the end of the tunnel

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
there. Even if it's the most minute thing,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
it's a huge milestone for, for them and to see a smile on their face

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Or especially my son's face, makes everything worthwhile.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
When he said "Mommy I love you. Thank you for doing this for me"

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
That. That's all I need. Finish this

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
sentence for me. I draw my strength from... My son.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
My son is the reason I wake up in the morning. He's the reason. My son and

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
my husband. My husband's very strong. My husband,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
we've been through a lot. Prior to Jason. During Jason

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
...But,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Without the two of them,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Life doesn't matter. Thank you so much for sharing his story.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Amazing lady. Thank you. I am so happy that other people will learn from your

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
experiences. And I just want to say thank you. Thank you.
