00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello, my name is Katherine Parker. I'm going to have a conversation

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with Delvin Cruz for Visible Lives an Oral

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
History Project for the New York Public Library. It is January 21st

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
2015, and we are at...

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Oh, it's January [laughs] January 22nd,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
sorry...2015, and we are at

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
City College of New York in Manhattan.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, Delvin, can you tell me...where you come from.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Originally born in Puerto Rico,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Ciales, small little town up in the country. One of the only towns that is

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
still, uh, countryside. No big malls have been built in there yet,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Thank God. I came to the United States at the age of 5 and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I grew up here in the United States, in the South Bronx.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And, um, can you tell me about, uh, growing up?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.000
.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Growing up was a little difficult. Uh, My father has

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
visual problems, his father has visual problems.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
His father's father has visual problems so it's a generic thing, um,but it's a generic

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
thing that not every one of your siblings gets it. My father has six kids and I'm the youngest

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and I'm the only one who was born with a disability. It starts out with congenital cataracts,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but when a kid is born with cataracts, technically means that the kid is born blind

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
until his eyes fully developed, because a cataract completely covers the entire eye,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
so the pupil doesn't have any.. any.. anything to see. It's obstructed.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So to the age of five I was completely born blind, I was blind. So

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
a lot of falls as you see. A lot of scrapes and bumps and marks as from-

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
from, when I, before I was five. Um, Living in the Bronx during

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
the 70s --  I was born in 1972, came here in 1977 -- raised in the Bronx

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Bronx from '77 and on, it was very difficult at that time.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Disability Awareness was not there and, it's not like now, the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
more people who are disabled are more accepted and there are more opportunities. Back then it was

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
none of that.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
My first year in school, when I went to first grade, I was

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
thrown in school with everybody else, and there I was, could barely see the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
blackboard, and on top of that, I didn't speak English, so I was only five years old

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and, I remember being scared and terrified.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And, not because I didn't know anybody, but because I couldn't see that well

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and I didn't understand what they were saying and what the teacher was saying.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It got a little better when I was transferred within a week to a

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
C.S. 90 which was one of the very first schools to start offering special

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
education for people with disabilities and got a little better there 'cause not only did they

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
use stuff for visually impaired- stuff written bigger but the teacher's assistant was Puerto Rican, too,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
so, I was actually able to learn a little more better since somebody was able to guide me and tell me what they were 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.000
saying.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But, not being able to see and being treated different

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
as a child or even as a youth growing you don't want to be treated different you want to

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
be like everybody else. And at that age, you don't really realize your

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
limits, so you get hurt a lot, whether it be falling or tripping or bumping

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
into things until you realize what are your limits are. You get hurt a lot and

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that was mostly my childhood and my preadolescence, discovering on my own, because I didn't want to be

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
different and I wanted to do what my other two brothers were doing and whatever my neighbors were doing, my

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
friends you know I want to do the same thing so I got hurt a lot learned how to ride a bike but I crashed a lot

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and I got hurt a lot, but I finally learned how to do it, though.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So what, uh, you

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Went then to Middle School? // Actually

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Um.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It's weird, cause I never went to middle school. I went from elementary to high school

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and the reason was, um, my first school in C.S. 90, they only kept

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
you to the 5th, grade but I don't know that if that time, they didn't have special education

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
didn't have inclusion classrooms. Where now students they were disabled there and they don't have

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
severe disability, like somebody like me, whos visually impairment. They can go and take classes with the

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
rest of the population and they receive the help they need but they are there with

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
everybody since they didn't have that they had in this

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
in this middle school in this elementary school in Manhattan. I don't remember the address

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
they had this little corner and the third floor of the classroom where there was two

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
rooms. One was for students there were

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
between the ages of 11 and 12 or 10 and 12 which was supposed to

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
be the 6th or 7th grade and then another rule once it was just

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
for the six grade, it was just for the lower. Once you got a to a certain age they moved it to your next room where you were there until

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
you were at the proper age to move to high school. So that I

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
never I never experienced what everybody's experience junior high school. When you start getting used to

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
going to different classroom you don't have one homeroom you don't have one you know I mean that was in the

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
entire day it was just like if it was just like regular elementary school the only difference is they taught us a little

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
more different school you know material you would learn in middle school high school

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
was the first school that I was actually in and a classroom with

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
everybody else.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And before that I guess that in having push I think it was because it was eighty seven.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I guess that's when they started what high school did

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
you go to one hundred and seventy eighth and Sheridan Avenue

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
in the Bronx. Did you know what your

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
siblings by the time I

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
finally went to high school.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
All my brothers my besides my younger sister they were already in high school and upper

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
levels the next one next to me is it was two levels above me then the next one was

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
in Siena and twelfth grade and my two sisters by

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
then already my tortoises are very back drop out already. But what I was going there my brother

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
was going to complete high school and I was going to town.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And were you know like classes like everyone else.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
My first semester I only have one class with everybody else

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
which was math and the other ones they

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
had I believe it was like just four teachers that taught one taught English

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
the other one taught reading and then I can and the other one was science

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that was until my sophomore year that they started letting that they'll actually take classes where everybody

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
else like health education in the arts and all

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the other classes.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
During this time. How do you deal with your disability

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Me really and I mean that's the negative

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
of having students just go straight just to special

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
education and mix them up with public school. What the general you know sort of having

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
inclusion is they have exclusion when you have inclusion you are allowed to

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
be in a classroom where everybody has to take in the same class you take on the same exams you get the

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
same learning at the same time when I went to high school the first

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
year or so it was more like you were in a room and to me it

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
felt like I was reading elementary books I was never a challenge at all

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and because I was never challenged and I just never paid attention and I just never I didn't

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
care it was until I started doing my that I was moved to

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
inclusion where I was.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Challenge and I was able to put more attention and was more interested in it

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
in the one you know in the world and went

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
through.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Sophomore the first shuttle Yeah I was allowed one class myself me and I think they

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
allowed me to classes and it was until my second year in

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
junior that they gave me a little leeway and finally by my senior year I

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
refused to do it in class I wanted all my classes to be

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
with the general you know I don't want to say don't publish because there's not a person but with everybody else

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and my thought was I wanted to go to college and I wanted to know if I can do college.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Because if you're in special education and you're not being challenge in you're not going to learn

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
what everybody says. Then you're going to have I'm going to be in a

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
disadvantage.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So even though I was advised not to go not to do it all that way. I

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
said I was going to and finally it was my decision because I had my mom write

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
a letter and say that if she didn't do it then moved me to another school.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
They let me do it and there was something about it and I think a lot about

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
that is that was my most fruitful in my most productive semester was my senior

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
year in high out of the seven hundred and

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
something people they graduated

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
. My average finished at the top twenty students

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and I was not bad at all and I was very impressed with that

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
How do you get fired in the classroom without being able to see my

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
teachers were understanding even though what I was not especially inclusion they were very

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
understanding in everything that I need to do is got to be enlarged

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and big papers at the time the closed circuit T.V.'s was the big

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
monitor big I mean giant monitors.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And I never liked us because they help you see but they also give you a migraine headache

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
because you have to be so close to it and I don't know a lot of the technology that was back that was

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
horrible.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I'm so how what was

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
it really did you have with your siblings.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Love hate but I think that's very powerful. Yeah

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I was one of the one my older brothers did. I

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
always wonder if they were in the streets ride their bikes. I wanted to do that too if they were in the park

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
climb his trees I want to do that too. The only problem

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
was my mom would let me do a lot of it because she was so worried that something would happen to me

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
. I guess you know that when I was playing my brother sometimes I'll just go into the things at least maybe

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
when I was talking a brothers hated me because they

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
didn't want to always be around me and when you're a kid you get that

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
impression. You know it's always know the grass is not always as brown as you think

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
it's always better. They were at the park and they were

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
playing a silly game where there everybody's telling different

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
stories what would you do if this happened. Meanwhile everybody would grab taking

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
the grasp on the grass and they were putting it and I don't know what was going on and next

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
thing I know everybody started on the grass and everything at me and my brothers and he was

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
in the in the circle he was playing around and.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I think he did it joking around just a little bit but when he did that everybody started turning

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and when everybody started this one kid grabbed

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
me when he threw it at me I see my brother get up I

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
thought it was you see him but he actually got out but he turned on he grabbed the kid who actually threw the but I mean I started

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
beating him up and at that point I realized yes me they're

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
actually teachers they're there with me but they were given the space for me to do

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
my stuff because they knew my mother would let me do it.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
So even though I thought they were getting they were always actually always there to help me out but they

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
gave me what my mom gave me they gave me the little leeway to let me get hurt

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
if I wanted to learn something so let alone on my own.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Well.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
What can you tell me more about that getting fun

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
discovering things on your own.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Running a bike was for him for years.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
You know when everybody learns to ride a bike their process is

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
learning how to balance the bike. Everybody's going to fall to the left or to the right

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
. I got the balance quick that was not my problem. I'm

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
stopping because that is the selling it comes a lot of I would bump into a

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
car or I would hit that sidewalk or a person so that was my

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
problem right there. And at first I got into a little out of the way it was because if I hit one of the

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
B.S.A. and when it's not your kid who's got the problems

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
everybody has a problem with what you know why you let his kid like this people get upset about it but

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
after a while I guess people just let me be in whenever they saw me on the bike they would just be

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
like the Red Sea the party people just a lot of the way it was kind of strange and weird

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
but I think what helped me the most was I am. The lighthouse over a fifty ninth Street

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
between Lexington and Park Avenue. I think they still have it. There's a program

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
that was set at a program where the people people who are visually impaired.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
You go there and depending on your age group they pair you up with that group

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and you're there for an entire Saturday and they teach you swimming

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
bowling. The new ceramic work

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
artwork that free time and when you get a little older like in

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
your in your twelve or thirteen in the mornings instead of being what everybody else in the

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
lighthouse you know playing games they take you to they had a case they

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
had an agenda but it was a few blocks away where you

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
go in there and he had trainers who help you learn how to use the

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
machines how to exercise but it was open to the general population the ages I

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
guess rented if they were they still had the regular members came in. So you had that right

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
there where one of the out of the week I wasn't legally

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
blind Why wasn't a different kid in the block or I was in a different kind in the house I

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
was there with everybody else who had the same problem. Some were actually more legally

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
blind. And the reason I think I like that the most because

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
me being able to see other people they had the same thing that I was going through kind

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
of helped me deal with the fact that I was in a room I was not the only one in the world

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
who was doing this because when you have a disability

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
sometimes and you start getting older you question why me why this is happening to me and you

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
think you're the only one. But going through that process and being around other kids that had it

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
helped me in two ways helped me realize that I was not alone

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and I saw how other kids took that impairment disability and

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
kind of like threw in the towel and didn't care they want to learn anything just accepted

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
that they were different and there will never be able to do anything so I took that as a challenge to say that I'll

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
never want to be like those like that group and I want to be like those that I saw it I never wanted to be like

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
that so again in mind and I learn to do a few things and I use that as a

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
motivator to be more risk taker to do more daring things.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
From elementary up through high school I had to take what we used to

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
call the cheese bus which is the yellow bug you know the school bus we call that the cheese

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
bus because at that time Lisa give American cheese for free to families low income

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
big block of yellow American cheese.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So the boss was a big a stickler the cheese but I had to take

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
it and when I was in high school I didn't want to take it from my mother she

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
wouldn't let me get off it I have my first day in high school I go on

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
to me that was very embarrassing. So my brother had to go to

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Clayton High School and his high school was on the way to my high school

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
. So what we started doing was he planned it that I would plan

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
every day. Sneak out and pretend I lost a boss I missed the bus in the first few days that whole

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
part of way with him. He told my mother he would. What went to school but what would you I would

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
do is we just walk to the bus stop yelling across the Grand Congress which was at that time he looked like a

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
giant ST To me it was on one hundred fifty seven wall and Grant Congress we had across

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
that. But once we were across the street he would go

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
his own way with his friends and he would leave me there because he already had taught me how to get to school I'll take the one

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
bus get off the one hundred and seventy street on how to do just what one blocks and cross one

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
street and the school was there after the third week of

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
school. My mother gets a letter saying that since I am not using the

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
bus that they're going to remove me from the list and that's the first time she learned about it she

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
was angry but when my brother you know like to her that he's been working with me every

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
day and that I'm the one in finding and I know how to do it. She finally loved me and that was what I

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
actually think was the first time of my independence where I was able to go to school on my

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
own and I have to go out on a bus or anything.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
What. Kind of what was

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
what was that like taking

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
taking public transportation.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Nothing weird.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
When you used to a routine every day where somebody picks you

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
up and then you got it all right and I pick you up around seven seven o five

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
seven ten seven ten in the morning to go around and pick up all the kids

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
and you go to school and by the time the driver reaches the school it's like eight thirty eight

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
forty five. They're on a bus for over an hour because the bus driver just didn't pick up people in

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
New York in the Bronx he had to go to Manhattan and I guess T..

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Oh look our arch with the bus was parked I guess it was close to my house because I

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
was always the first one to be picked up again on a bus and

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
you know one day you get there in less than ten minutes it was like a

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
different it was soul like free time because once you got there

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
you you had time to do other stuff you had time to go and have lunch and actually meet friends

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
and develop friends and when you go

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
to war when you go to a school and there's a lot of kids in your neighborhood or nearby they

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
take the same route and go to the same school and you go to the same bus every

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
day after a week or two you start talking and you become friends and you start you know

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
develop in this groups or cliques or whatever they want to call it.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
And you start socialising and meeting more people that are not your it you know that or not with

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
your disability but since you're at high school already that I don't care

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
anymore you know it's I was pretty strange good at the same time

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
be in Azad the buzz where you have to sit in put a simple line and the

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
buses back them was not like the buses now you have the two seats and then another one behind two

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
more scenes and another one and it was straight seat in one so I kind of like the way the

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
trains are but not the one to decide the number four train the let's you know the six

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
train would be a better example. Well that just once I was all like that

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
. No matron to tell you to sit down to walk around

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
and it was I found I found that to

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.000
be fun.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Can you talk about you.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Growing. Like what do you do

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
you talk a little bit more about your parents.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
My mom and my dad divorced before I was born

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
my dad is more visual impaired than I am I see better than he does.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Hi I don't need glasses to see around he has

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
glasses that are like Coke bottles. Bottom of coke bottles are like real thick and if you don't

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
you know that when he can't see at all. But he was a

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
history teacher in high school in Puerto Rico and he taught for thirty six

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
years and he's a genius My

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
father is a genius I feel he has AIDS and eidetic memory which is what most people call a

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
photographic memory. He

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
would have his students open the book.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
And he will start reading the book. But he will start walking around the room as he's

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
reading because he already memorized it and the store has to catch him on an

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
errand then following along.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
While I like my home and I think that was his technique to teach him to follow follow

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
and never caught him on a mistake because it would follow because they want they would they want to do with that

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
one they want to be that one student it would find him making a mistake that he said something it was not on the page

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
when he said something that was wrong and I never did and he is

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000
just real smart.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
My mother I think Elementary was the highest level she did she did

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
she got married I believe age of thirteen. Back at that time I guess that was the

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
norm here. Yeah kids don't kids got

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
married very young. Back then I think she got married in either

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
nine hundred sixty one or fifty nine I don't remember the exact year

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
but she got married just to get out of my grandma's house

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
come from the fashion family where they really

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
don't know how to raise people their race and the way they were raised and that's by

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
hitting them young then turning them into slaves. Given no

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
love.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Just a horrible way to grow up and they just can't pass it down

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
and that's the way that was I was taught as to what you were taught.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
I'm glad my brothers and sisters didn't teach to teach their kids that way they broke the

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
cycle. At one

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
point I didn't think my mom loved me just

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
because the way she treated me different and everybody else now that

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
I'm older I understand it. She was worried about my disability and having a visual

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
impairment. He can't let you could go out running around in the street by a

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
car or something can happen I understand that at least now I do but

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
when I was growing up I just I just thought she was a she me.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
I'm actually going to see my father now on vacation next week going to Puerto

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Rico. He lived there he never came here.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
My father.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
He's awesome even though he didn't race me I

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
have a lot of respect for him for how much we accomplish would be less efficient than I

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
have in a country where he didn't have accommodations when he

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
went to school when he went to high school there was no such thing accommodations and he

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
succeeded not just being a teacher being an awesome teacher

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
has only negative was that he was a drunk and that's the reason he started teaching.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:39.000
He stopped teaching. But other than that he he's very he

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:44.000
has. Thank God he hasn't drank in over twenty years now. He stopped drinking. He's very

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000
respected in the time. Whenever I visit I say I look identical like my father

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
when he was young when he was my age when I was his age I mean that was so

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
they recognized and went whenever I'm visiting him.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
If I'm walking anywhere people give me a lift and they start talking about my

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
father and the funny thing is it's the same people pick me up every time I go and they get older

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
and I guess since I'm not there all the time they forget become of the story and they repeat the same stories all over again

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
. But I enjoy it because it's like reruns you know are you can you go to

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
like listen to stories about your parents. People are proud to tell you about stuff they did.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
What kind of stories.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Yeah. Next question

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
OK So your mom came to New York with

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
you and your siblings that your dad said I

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
told you when I was born in one thousand seventy two when my parents before I was born I was already

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
divorced my mother got a

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
boyfriend and then which is my younger sister's father and we came

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
out and by the age I was five so from maybe till I was

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
maybe six seven or eight months somewhere around there. My stepfather was the

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
one that was there living with two we were five till I was five then in one thousand

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
seventy seven he had his first daughter and he didn't want to raise my

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
sister in Puerto Rico. So they come as my mom and we came to the United States

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
that was in one thousand of them was my sisters or

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
me. So around September of one thousand seventy seven we came to New

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
York and he moved into the apartment been no

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
we moved into my aunts my mother's sisters my aunt's

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
apartment for a few months until we found the place it was

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
at one hundred fifty fifty or fifty six and Melrose Avenue.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Which is nothing the way it used to be like there is a lot of burned buildings at that

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
time and none of the buildings they were there at the time was there anymore the second buildings look nice

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
now for a few months we lived with my

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
aunt and my aunt already had three kids. Most are

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
self and it was only a two bedroom apartment it was pretty crowded. A church we met this

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
lady her name was loose and. She didn't know what she just

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
matter there and after like maybe a month of knowing her shopping our house and we were

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
able to move in with her and she showed my mom where to

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
get um she's the one who took my mom and told her to put me in special ed

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
and got her all the paperwork squared take me to school where they would help me I

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
took my mom so we can get Social Security and when they prove that I was

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
glad I got mean the commission for the Blind which was the last book in the light house

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
and with her I think we lived for one year and then we finally got our own apartment when we were living

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.000
along.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
It's all problems. Rose by one hundred forty nine hundred

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000
fifty fifty one run the whole neighborhood

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
and.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
What did you say you mentioned biking or no. But

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
imagine that like the bike. What other things did you go around the

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
neighborhood with for fun.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Than what you see on the square. I grew up in

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
the greatest neighborhood in New York in the Bronx. Two

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
blocks away from the greatest New York in the

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
history of the sport I grew up two blocks away from Yankee Stadium. Yankee Stadium was

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
my background. Since we lived there

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
every weekend but in the summers when there was no school and there was honking we would go

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
to the games.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
It was I think it was big for all six kids to go to the game

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
and my mom and my step father I think he spent less than fifteen dollars for everybody to go

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
. Probably even less than ten people was at that time. So we were able

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
to go there and whenever the NGO My mom sent me and my two brothers to the

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
game we would ride a bike all around the entire Yankee Stadium in the

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
parking lots they have a mortgage they just built

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
a few years ago maybe five years ago maybe a little less gateway more

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
that's a little further from the or Yankee Stadium it's where we

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
used to be the markets not to Hans point where they have all of the

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
vegetables all the fruit and they mass produce and sell it by

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
both people in the streets. It used to be there and it used to be also an

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
abandoned and abandoned train station

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
and we had after five or six o'clock when it's done it's just a fun place if

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
you're a kid to go play around just because you got it all subway station you

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
roll around in the stuff that you get away your parents don't see you you can get

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
away with things and they would throw away the

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
vegetables they didn't sell that were going bad they will promote side and work and don't like to grab

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
vegetables and throwing stuff and stuff like that.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Now each other all friends everybody was playing

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
instead of points Nobile the plate on Rotten Tomatoes or whatever and we just saw

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
saw from being out into song to go I want you to come because you always find

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
some good ones here.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
We used to go there once. Once my mother discovered it did it threw away

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
food. That used to go there after his clothes and make up like

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
plant things banana carrying lettuce and

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
stuff that they know that was going to go bad the next day they knew that by the time the next day

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
came they would be able to sell so they would put it out and people come take it. Now they let it

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
run away. So we used to go there and I used to enjoy going there. It's

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
just fun and one time my mother was going and she didn't want me to go

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
from getting troll or something I don't remember what I know I'm not hard to get drugs she let me go because whenever

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
she goes you always take me with her because when she found out what we lived through

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
does throw things around and she found out that there was a railroad station

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
and next to it was the East River but there's no there was no law. No

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Gates or fences or anything. So anybody could just walk right into the river and Foreman

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
and she discovered that she would let me go further so whenever I go it was on she went

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
and one time I think I don't know what I did You can let me know and I was so angry that I

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
actually literally punched and broke a window because I was angry that I was only I was able to

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
do to go and then I try to tell that somebody to a bawling not

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
realize and then if someone had broke all the glass would have been and so I think

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
kids do funny how you see seventy

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
three.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Maybe less not seven or eight yeah. Definite was over six because that was

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
an Gerard Adnan who lives in Girard Avenue hundred

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
and fifty seven for a few years and then moved to one block

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
up one hundred fifty seven and walked in and there we lived two I think in one thousand nine

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000
hundred sixty one nine hundred eighty seven

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000
. One time in that neighborhood.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Very dangerous neighborhood to this at this point

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
. This was before Rudy Giuliani actually

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
made the city especially the bronze a place where even tourists can come and visit

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
and where I lived. Only that they only that they said they were Yankee

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
games. Would you see a lot of police officers and it was just to protect the people

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
again when there was no games. You barely see a cop. I

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
remember when I was twelve years old they shot this guy

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
right in the middle of my building entrance line

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
. That guy was there for over six hours

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
before the first cop came but I don't

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
blame this one cop was chasing I think it was a rookie who

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
was chasing this does this person a drug dealer or whatever.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
And chase him to the roof and next thing you know the cops

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
find out of the room.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
Yes it was very dangerous and since cops didn't feel safe they wouldn't go

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
no matter what lived on the first floor.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Whenever there was a gunshot the first team. Our stepfather taught us to do

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
. Jump you know tell yourself to the ground and then

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
crow it was like this big hole we between the two rooms crawl on which were the

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
hallways and you stay there. So if a bullet goes through the window doesn't

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
hit one of us because a little five year old girl she was in a room

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
playing doll and a bullet went through of your own apartment

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.000
and live there for so long that gunshots

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
probably like three times a day. You got your tongue itself in the

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
ground in one thousand you know the one

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
I graduated from high school and applied to

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
. College. But at this time I was

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
entering my Rebel stage where I didn't want to live with my mom anymore. I felt like I could live on my

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
own and my only way to do that was to go to college

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
so I found the college that I can go to that was the furthest the longest farthest

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
away. I'm going to post miss college

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
postman's college is next to a town called Saranac Lake

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
And that probably town is now familiar. That town is next

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
to another town that is familiar Lake Placid which

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
is forty five minutes from the Montreal border in Canada

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
. It's roughly four hundred something miles

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
and the only way to get there was at around the

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Trailways because it's in the Adirondacks and there's one and only one bus goes there daily

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
. The bus leaves here in the morning at nine

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
and he gets there a little close to eight thirty at night because he does a

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
lot of stops and it stops in Albany for a while. Steps in Syracuse for a while and he just

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
does it well is dropping but it drops you off there and it's in the middle of

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
nowhere and.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
I went to this school and it's country or country

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Saranac Lake is eighteen miles away from plasmas college plasmas college is in a

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
little town of Posner's with a population of less than five hundred people.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
The closest store convenience store to the school

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
was five miles away and that was only open at certain times if you wanted to

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
go to a restaurant or you want to go to a supermarket you have

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
to go to the Saranac Lake which is eighteen miles away which I love riding my back so I wrote that

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
bike every day eighteen miles back in eighty miles back

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
but the reason I'm going to this story is I was accepted into plus his college degree

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
program which is the Higher Education Opportunity program a G.O.P. which I think now

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
it's got a different name and the way they did

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
their program was they put the students in for a month

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
for part of June not part of July and most of June

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
July and most of August and they let you take it remedial classes and then let you take the

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
class so you can get used to the you know the college situation because they're all freshman's and most

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
of the people going there are minorities or people who are disadvantaged

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
and. You're on the weekends we go we go on different

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
retreats whether it be a hike a mountain couldn't write a

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
farmer's market just one weekend they had to firemen's convention in

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Tupper Lake and this is a convention for a whole bunch of firemen's where they do a

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
whole bunch of stuff that people here in the Bronx go look at it or even in the ACBL. What these

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
people do and carving words into frames what would happen with the chainsaws

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000
breaks and doing a whole bunch of weird stuff but the reason of my story is I was at McDonald's

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
on line to get food and I was

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
the only minority. The only Hispanic in the world in the town of what

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
we call Hicks people from the locals you know with a

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
flannel shirt or beard and you.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Know managed to know all black people here they want to match their shoes to their parents

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
or their shared this often is that there's no mash at all nothing.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
And I'm online winning each winter because I can

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
play something Ronald McDonald was with a whole bunch of kids

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
And they're going to lose and they do want to do one of those helium

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
tanks and Latin pop

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
briefing was the first thing I did.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
I threw myself to the ground just yet. I thought it was a gotcha.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
When I'm in the government my my friend real speedy because that's what they call me because I was always in a rush to go in

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
my you know when I looked I was so I'm biased you got up and left.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
And I told him I thought it was a gut check.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
That's my money here but it's going to Utah he's up to the ground and I

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
threw myself on the ground like I'm such a reflex Yeah it's like why

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
am I the only wonderful on the one hand there isn't my first time and it was visible when I got some hours I got

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
it I got up and that I should have because nobody knew what nobody knew me there.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Yeah you

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
know more about being at college. But

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
yeah it's nice by the way I'm going to

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
need a copy of this.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Oh totally. I'm a creative writing major and I graduated last semester and

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
I did a few memoirs that some of my did about my childhood but

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
all of this at a time when you know I could not remember but I mean those stories

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
and I'm going to have to live mine.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
My memoirs in college you know

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
my first weird experience I got to the

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
different reads We went to High St Regis mountain

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
and I've never hiked the mountain in the city

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
is going to go into the middle of the woods just to walk in the woods to climb all the way to the top

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
with there's nothing to have to call all the way back down it

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
doesn't make sense to somebody who lives in the city.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Jim Tucker was the name of the director of the of the G.O.P. program and

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
he comes up to me the day before we were going and he goes

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
hiking amount today do you have a proper shoe too

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:05.000
high.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
I'm like yeah I know what he was talking I know he was asking if I had hiking boots.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
I had a high top sneakers feline which was red

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
velvet and I supposed to get wet. And that's what I

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
took. To go hiking with. I'm hiking

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
and one thing you don't know if you are not from that area and you know high

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
mountain and if you need it in rain the day before

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
and it rained three days before there is hide

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
and what not.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
The entire trails are silent and

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
mean by this point there

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
is no one around me and is because I tell them

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
I was talking like a New Yorker. F. this F. that anything is bugged. You

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
know the way New York was rude in foul language

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
so they don't want to hear it so that everybody walked on their employees

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:17.000
.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000
So. I need to know somebody to be there is watch your step of this or I'm

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
walking and I want to put my stuff I want to go

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
over a piece of tree that was on the ground so I want to go

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:35.000
over it. When I stepped on it it was completely self mine.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.000
My only when all the way to my knees in mud

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
. Those red light red feel like sneakers I told you about we're not red no longer

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
so I took my foot out and I saw that I was screaming and

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
cursing like there was no time like where's my counselor thought

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
that's often happened to me so he came back and see what was going on when he saw that it was my

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
sneakers and he looked at me he goes I thought you said you have proper attire and he

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
just kept walking away. Next day he bought me a pair of boots

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
says here next time you go using I one can no one once

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
and I was on my own. I enjoyed going canoeing

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
for some reason I enjoyed the quietness. It took me a

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
little while because it's kind of we when you live in New York taxis

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000
guns fired on arms fire drugs police and ambulance

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
and in my blood gunshots everything so much noise you can't hear yourself think. When I

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
was there it's like high heat. Once five o'clock came

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
I could actually hear the antics and it reminded me when I read this in Puerto Rico.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
So I kind of enjoyed it and that was like my sanctuary so I would go in the canoe and go out

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
. And I would go in the middle the first time I went to my When I went to the middle and I just

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000
you know put the pedal down and just lay down and relax

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
on that which is let the crew do it something if you want to meet

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000
underneath a big tree and I guess I go this is cool is kind of sunny and I think I'll stay here for a

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
little while in the middle of July up in Iraq in

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
July they have these flies to be called black flies at The

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Ohio. They do you like there's no

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
tomorrow and their sting hurts for a while I

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
had a big flock of black flies climbing over me when I woke up all of

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
them. Oh my God I was so horrible but I had in mind

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000
you know it's my mind that at that time but the other the experience you learn

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
from being in there.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
My first semester after that summer I was in the middle of diverse

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
one of my roommates and a friend was from Orange County New York

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000
. The other one was from Long Island. The other one was from Buffalo New

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000
York and one was from Japan.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
There were fun fun guys we got in we got over and rode together and did a lot of wild

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.000
and crazy stuff the first time I got drunk.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
It was the weirdest thing in the world. I don't know

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
I don't have a big astigmatism I said I used to have a few years ago

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
I had one might let my eyes corrected in two thousand and

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
seven. They did the last surgery so I don't have that much severe stigmatise they

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
still move around but I had it even worse. But when I first got drunk I

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
discovered that my eyes straightened out

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
one hundred percent straight up and I was able to see better. Like this is my

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
weakest of my week I and

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
I thought that that was a cool thing so I decided to get drunk again and get drunk again

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000
. After a while you know that's all you do. Especially when the live upstate New

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
York and it's winter from September to probably the first week of June

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
when I flunked out of school my first semester that O F's

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000
. Well yeah I don't want to blame the teachers I don't

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
want to blame my disability I didn't know what to do with my

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
freedom. I was like a spring that was kept in a jar and when I

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
was finally opened it was so much compression I just went nuts went crazy.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000
I went to school from ninety one to one thousand

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.000
ninety eight and all I got out of it was just an Associates.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
I went back to college in two thousand and eleven.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
I would apply to leave in college when they told me that my G.P.A. was below

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
it so I needed to improve my grades be allowed. So my plan was just to go to

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Bronx community college for one semester and hopefully get a great job. My first semester I got all eight

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
courses and I thought it was a fluke so much I will take one more

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
semester and I got another eight or a pass' after my

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
second semester so that all I mean it was just to classes to get a degree in early childhood

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
education side but they might as well stay there. So I

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
stayed there and I got a pluses through the entire three semesters

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
. By the time I graduated I I was graduating and I

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000
applied this time I decided to put City College first. Even though I didn't think I was going to get accepted

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
with my G.P.A. from the Bronx community they accepted me right away and I came here

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
in the fall of two thousand and twelve and just graduated last semester.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Would a three point seven seven nine G.P.A..

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
There's all the stories in college when I can't go through life because the public is going to

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
listen to it. Some of my future employers might listen to have you know this

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:14.000
crazy

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000
those who went to college who had to drive away to go to college they know one of them

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
going to be you know I think that's the true excuse a college you got to learn to fold

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:29.000
.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
You know to get up and you experience prepares you for the real world I think

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000
in a small way.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Definitely And that's true.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.000
So what do you do in between going to

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000
college in the Adirondacks and then going to college

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000
.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
In one thousand nine hundred eighty. Was when I graduated from

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Clayton community college and when I finally got my associates

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000
and what did you and sorry I don't mean you know what did you get yourself

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
green as just liberal arts liberal studies.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000
And the only reason I didn't do that was because I flunked out of the Sony Sony POS and which is the school

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
I went to the poster's college because when I went to post-college I would ask

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.000
my I did my major was clean their yards and I wanted to be a

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
chef when I went to take the classes and I discovered that they don't teach

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
you how to cook.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
They used to teach you how to make the preparations look good and

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
you know the secrets of the business management so they don't teach you how

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.000
to cook they don't care if your food tastes good so is your preparation looks good you get a grade

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:49.000
.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000
So once I discover that I don't really want to waste my time doing that so I just I just finished two years

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
important colleges because I like the place and I mean I was amazed to leaf

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000
.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000
I remember one time I was on my fridge This was my first semester later on when I took my first chef

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
class and we were supposed to do.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Cut cut potatoes and they're teaching us how to do some type of BRAF or consummate I

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000
don't know what it was and because of that they do teach you how to make

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000
consummate a sauce and Sue's but they don't teach you any of those nice fancy recipes out of created you know

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000
it was not what I was looking for but I was cut and material in my carrots.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000
A conversation with my next door with the person next to me and I'm not looking out

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
for the people who are not seeing a lot of looking at what I'm cooking. My head is turned to the left side

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000
and I'm talking and I'm just cut and cut and cut and I was stunned.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Chef comes next to me ghost over can you please look at

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000
what you're cutting you got me nervous you're gonna cut your fingers off because you're not

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
paying attention and I go look at him like Professor what's the

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
difference if I look at it I'm still not seeing one.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000
But he just laughed and it was true if I don't see what I'm bored let's

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.000
look into the person next to me. I cut it by feeling to myself I feel when I'm doing

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000
stuff and I kind of learned a trick where you kind of put you give

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000
him you Ben you're NOT course then you let the my rest on you

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000
and your nails

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000
. So if you do going to get cut what's going to get thing is you're now and you've got to feel it so you know

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000
you've got to close and I actually thank God I never cut

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000
myself with a knife when I was doing all that stuff.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000
But I want to post in college and I joined a fraternity in one thousand

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
spring one nine hundred ninety four and got really interesting.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Well this is the reason I joined a fraternity I don't think I'll ever do that is because

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000
after coming to college in one thousand ninety one. And then

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.000
transfer him to Sunny Hostin Potsdamer your Which is next to

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Plattsburgh in the one nine hundred ninety three

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000
I met my first Puerto

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Rican friend or Hispanic friend in general but it was

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Puerto Rican and we hit it off pretty well we both were from

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000
New York we're both Puerto Rican and we both enjoy the Yankees.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:33.000
When I learned he was in a fraternity he invited me to all the parties I used to go and hang out

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000
all the time that I'm like you know what I'm asking you to join your thousand pledge a fraternity

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000
so I pledge that in I was and this party from ninety eight

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000
I can see is that from spring one nine hundred ninety four to one thousand

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
nine hundred eighty my it's a blur. It's a blur and

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000
I remember my heart. Yes so I had to go to another school to

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:02.000
say they gave me the probations and after that they go sorry you're out

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000
. So I'm I am I finally got the associates and after

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000
ninety ninety eight I stayed in class because that's what Clinton was. Community colleges in Plattsburgh New

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000
York found a roommate who was nice and he got me a job at a restaurant as a

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000
as a dishwasher and I started working there and

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.000
I'm doing the dishes that's my job there are just a dishwasher nothing else.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000
This guy used to be the head chef here he went to college

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000
.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
And he.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.000
So I was talking about plus missile I mentioned that I was on the placement.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.000
We start talking about the professors there and how everything nice

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.000
was there for the restaurant walked by and they were

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000

Answer was yes and they can tell you it's in Plattsburgh

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000
OK yeah it's a seafood restaurant and season one they only join the summer

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000
because the lake freezes it's right in the marina so all the people with the boat

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
syllables it's the big thing in that corner.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Right here is a nice restaurant. I moved back to New York in two

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
thousand.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.000
And winter of two thousand and one story and

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:14.000
got my life straight and in two thousand and three stop drinking anything

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.000
else that bad habits that I acquired in college and in my fraternity

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.000
started going to church for no reason I didn't hit rock bottom only five most people all the

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000
fun went to church because he was a rock bottom I was raised in church. Russell look at race and

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Pentecostal one day I just got tired of where my life was headed so I

Do you have to leave by five.

I don't finish what I started over there. I got at least an

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:02.000
hour of work over there. But anyway I mean my wife a church

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.000
OK. She didn't want anything to do with me.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000
According to her I was a loud person.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000
I can't believe I mean you can blame me I was a drummer. Drummers are

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.000
loud. We're used to those things and we're almost there. We gotta speak louder

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000
so I started joking around with her because her last name was

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Cruz my last name is crude. So joking around you know we get married you don't

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000
have to change your name. Suddenly she didn't want to have anything to do

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000
with me she's five years older than me like now going to

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000
sleep. I get mad when a little kid consider me to be a mature

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000
kid. She used to tell me all the stories on how anything she

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:56.000
wanted she would pray to God and God always answered the prayers

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:01.000
that no matter what she wanted that God answered our prayers. So she talked so much

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.000
about that that one day when I turned thirty years old.

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:11.000
I was praying the custom of praying every night for you go to bed when you wake up. I was praying

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000
and I was kind of dirty and single not married

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Nothing so I was kind of I started crying and God You know

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.000
I need to get married before I turned thirty one and I was like you know what

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000
that I don't want to waste my time of this girl if she doesn't want to be

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000
with me. But if this is the girl that you have for me I want you to change her

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.000
heart and make fun of me. Three months later we got married

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
we still married.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:50.000
I guess God does answer. Craig so she's like

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000
I don't understand how we got married like a year later she goes how we got married I HATE

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000
MY don't we always tell God Anything you ask me gives you've got to

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000
change your heart and make you fall in love with me. So it's your fault so whenever something goes wrong she's

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000
angry with you having cheer for you gave me the secret I had to

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000
cut this.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000
So I'm going to finish with something if you have any other questions for that.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000
I just applied to the New York City teachers fellowship and I'm hopeful hoping hoping that I get

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:28.000
accepted I want to be a teacher in the city of New York dealing with special education

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000
kids. I want to be able to help those young kids

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.000
so that I struggled what I struggled because I went through the system and

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000
I don't like that way.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Let's just put it this way to have a kid.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:48.000
I wouldn't trust them in the same teachers that taught me I was at a huge disadvantage when I

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.000
went to college. They were talking about books that I've never heard before

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000
and there are books that every kid has reading in high school. Catarina right.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Those you know the basic books I didn't read any of those books.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:08.000
And they I don't know if it's still the same attitude because I don't I don't go to public

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:13.000
school and I don't want to put the added to when I was growing up was just call them their into

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000
their of age and just move them on. So she's more will you got a malakas

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.000
you turn your age and you got to move on and I don't think that's fair to students

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:27.000
who really want to learn and really want to make something with their life. I want them to see

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:32.000
that there is hope even if you're disabled you can still become something in life

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.000
.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Thank you so much to all of them. It's a pleasure hearing your story and

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000
speaking with you wish we had more time I said

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.000
maybe we can pick this up some other time if you like. Yeah maybe

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:53.000
.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:55.000
OK.
