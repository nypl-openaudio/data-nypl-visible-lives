So uhm tell me a bit uh about where you uhm

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
where you lived growing up and what it was like.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I grew up in Queens, New York

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
house and uhm my family ... What part of

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Queens?  I lived in Hollis Hills. So uhm

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
it's like kind of on the border of Long Island. Uhm

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It was like two.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I don't know, whatever.  You know, it was like Long Island was within

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
two miles from there you know and stuff. So, uhm,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Yes so I grew up there um.. my family 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I have an older brother and my dad who's a doctor

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
smoker and we had a dog and

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a very normal childhood.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
My parents came from India in the early

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
sixty's and uh

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
so you know, uhm, you know

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
as a child, you know, it was kind of like a little

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
confused, like, in the way that, like, when I went to school, I was like, like everything

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but, then going home it would be like cultural.  Yeah, was it very different?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
No. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Very different, but it's, you know, it's like, you know, so like my

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
parents were like, a little bit more restrictive than other families

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and stuff like that.  But not, that, you know, I mean, they did

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
socialize and stuff like that and it wasn't like I wasn't allowed to you know um

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Other people or anything.  No, it wasn't like that. Did you grow up around

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
other Indian friends?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
. Yeah, yeah like So it

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
was basically, like, during the week it was like a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
normal kind of thing and then over the weekend, we went to other

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Bengali families and stuff like that. And then we had like

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Bengali school on Sundays and stuff like that.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.000
so

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So yeah. So it was kind of like a double

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Yeah. But, you can verlay or other

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
people could relate to you - yeah - other 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Bangali friends. Yeah yeah OK so

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I know that you full disclosure. I know, Sunita, so

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Press Corps. Yes, I went to undergrad to University

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Michigan and then I went to Boston University for Law School and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
then um I also went to

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
get my master's degree but that was after I became disabled

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
became disabled like a few

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
years after I graduated from law school. Maybe, like three

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
years after...three four years after and um.. Were you 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
working? I was working.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
yea. And um

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
What kind of law firm. ok. So I worked in a medium sized law firm

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I worked ?idea down? medical malpractice defense work so I represented

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Doctors and hospitals in New York City. Did you like it?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I like it.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So when do you start having ?headache?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
experience with disabilities of

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
well how did it happen um

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Your disability? Well my disability started

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
in my consciousness it was when I had the stroke I had a stroke

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
in July of 2000 and

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
1

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So yea

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Like a few months before that or maybe like

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
four or five months before the stroke I did have an episode of losing

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
my vision for a period of like twenty minutes or so

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and it could be related or it could could have been like if

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
they looked into it more or they would have known that I had

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
But that's like you know it's

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Could of, should of kind of. But um so I didn't have any 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
thing before having the stroke. So when I had the stroke I went to the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
hospital and everything you know happened um

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
the morning of the stroke um, I woke up in the middle of the 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
of the night and I felt like my leg was being a little funny

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
but I felt like I just like slept on it and I just got up and

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
went back to sleep. And later in the morning when I woke up

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I tried to brush my teeth and stuff and it was just very funny and off

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
everything. So then that day I was 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
supposed to go to a client and uh 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
do a review and ?deposition? of somebody and 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that um. I just felt really like my hand 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
wasn't working and stuff. So I called my dad in the morning

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and I was like I feel a little funny um but you know

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I try to brush my teeth and it was weird and

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
everything and um. He was like well you should go check it out and I was like

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
was like I'll check it out after after ?deposition?.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And he was like OK take down my number.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And if anything happens cause my dad is a doctor so he's very concerned

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and so then I try to write down his number and I just

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
really couldn't do it he was like

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Now call 911 and go to the hospital and I'll

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
meet you there

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
What did you feel?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Did you stay conscious? Yea I stayed conscious 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And um how did your father 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
or your family deal and when did you find out

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
that I had a stroke? Yeah. Right away? Yeah

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Within like a couple of hours you know.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
So how long did you stay in the hospital?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
um I stayed in the hospital for 3 

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
weeks and then I went to a rehab in ?patient? for another 3 weeks 

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.000
weeks

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
But um after being in the hospital, I had a second stroke ten days

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
days later while I was still in the hospital so and after the second stroke

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
second stroke was a lot worse

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I couldn't talk, I couldn't do much and so

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
yeah.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Do you remember what you were thinking.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
When it happened? Yea I was talking to a couple of friends that came 

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
over and saw me in the hospital and all of a sudden

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
my talking became very weird and in my mind I felt like

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I shifted to Spanish even though it was probably like 

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
like ?Garbam? but you know

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And then um. Do you speak Spanish? Not really

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
really I mean I had classes in Spanish and stuff, I can 

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
you know but not off the top of my head or anything

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
So then um my brother came

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
he's a doctor also. And so he was like OK you need to lay down

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
be quite and let me get the doctors and everything and then you know 

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
what was your recovery like?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
things that you have to work on? Talking 

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
occupational therapy, physical therapy

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
hand therapy and everything.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So yeah. So what was that like? Was it hard work?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Yeah it was hard work but you know I was very um

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I was very.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I mean I worked hard they did everything they told me to and everything but I was very

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
resistant for things like be in a wheelchair and

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
be like no you know and they are like no you need to be in a 

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
wheelchair and I'll be like all right if I have to have the wheelchair, I will take it 

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
you know cause I was like there's no need for me not

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
you know what you know and so... But you

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
said ? I did it for like half a day

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
like why am I in it you know but like now like

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
now over the years I've realized that walking is very

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
difficult and so I get a wheelchair if I'm on the plane 

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I can't really walk throughout the entire airport and stuff like

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
that so I get a wheelchair and stuff..it's not that I'm resistant to it but they

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
wanted me like just to go down the block you know with the

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
wheelchair and I was just like whatever you know

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Ok so you. And I'm like

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
one of the things was like

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
They fitted me into um something for my leg

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Um and so it was just like 

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
brace and a very bulky brace you know and I was like 

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I am not gonna wear it you know. They are like yes you do..

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I was like OK whatever you know I let them do whatever they want

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
but what would I wear it? No. You were 

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
showing your personality, you were not going to be a 

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
my standard and for ?no care? No I mean I would do

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
everything like they don't want to but you know like you know

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
in my mind I was just like you know like no I did wear a brace 

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
for like first couple of days or so you know

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
That's all. Yea so it was just you know 

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I just knew I'd rather 

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
walk disabled than the brace

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It makes for a nicer shoes. Yeah exactly.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
How did you experience? I know your life after

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
After a year. Did you return to work?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Um I tried 

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
returning to work but I went in and talked to them 

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I was like can I come back to work and everything. They're like

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
We're not sure.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I mean because I needed to talk to them because I couldn't go back

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
to my old status that was for sure and especially while I couldn't 

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
really talk as well so you know and

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and my you know I had to learn to write with

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
my left hand and everything and

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
walking was still fairly slow and everything so it wouldn't be

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
the same but you know like I could go back and

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
do um a lot of like I couldn't like

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
go to um court as much but I could do 

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
do all the briefs for other journies and stuff 

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
But they never really let me go 

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Go back and you weren't

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I wanted to try but you know I

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Right after New Year's and like within like the next year

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
or so. So. I would say when they like

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
it here.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Like it took me a year to talk as little as I do now.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
I still had patient moments for

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
you and.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Me. Faiza.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Very much but I've been after a year

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
it was I would be stuck on certain words and so I

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
learned to well it was like

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
You know it's like I was here.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
An example is like I know in my mind I wanted my dad to

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
bring me a purple and black suitcase but I

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
would say you don't really need any purple but

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
then I'd forget what I just said and then I don't have to like start

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
over if you like and then I forget to say one of the

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
words and stuff like.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
That and I think I can see it in my mind well exactly what I want but I

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
can't get the words out. His various frustrate Yeah yeah

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
yeah. And so you know. And you dare I say

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I say I had a moment where I couldn't get the word out. But I

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
learned to lie. Describe what I want to even though I

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
couldn't say with precise order and then

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
eventually I would say maybe like when and like

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
three or four years. I wouldn't say any

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
more but it you know and I'll

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
let you know I mean I mean I guess I still do but you know it's not a big

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
deal in my mind and he will miss

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
his film is.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Set a year be years and years

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
for people.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Fun Day body change so much after the first few

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
months by apparently.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Yeah I would say so.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
So I would say then like

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
the first year I probably didn't even try to work a brain

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
link after the first year to maybe two

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
or three years I am really trying to

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
get a night but I applied for different positions and still

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
get very far and I mean being

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
down.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So then I decided to go back and look and

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
See what I wanted to do

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
was like then I could go to a hospital and work for the

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
hospital in my

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
you know legal department in the hospital and stuff like that

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
so I had two Masters in Public Administration and specialized in

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
health care policy staff and then I got a

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
job not related to

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
them but it kind of worked for non not for I work

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
for a private organization where they had

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
my role. The company at home

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
. Basically all the medical

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
information for our hospitals

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
doing elective surgeries. So it was like making sure they

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
get all the required documents and everything and stuff like

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
that and it was there for like

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
two or three months to weigh in and then I think I

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
kept getting sick and sick and meaning going

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
into the hospital then like you know

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
it was like little you know it was

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
and I don't know why it was like I had There's something happening with my

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
teeth my liver or you know it's just like my levels were

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
off it. And another time I just couldn't eat and stuff like

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
that so everything kept happening and at that point

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
and. I was I was getting paid well and

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
stuff but at that point it was like it was like well you know it's like six months

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
into it and I was.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Also when I started on steroids and stuff like that because

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
that helped with my issues and

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
everything. So in my mind it might change my mind or something.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
That's when I said you know I really thought about it and I said

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
I really need to stay on long term disability as opposed to

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
because I already did six months of it and in my mind I

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
did another six months. That would be it would be cut off completely. And

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
I said that might be a little too much of a risk because I kept getting

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
sick and stuff like that and so my mind said you know

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
it's better to kind of step back and really think

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
about doing it. So I went back to the job and I said

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
I'll still be here or else but I want to go part time and

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
don't pay me for a little while and then until I figure out what's going

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
on and everything. Because I wanted not

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
to be paid because I didn't want to get paid because it will go against the six

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
months you have so so.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
If I have her find out while you were out. What are

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
you kidding me saying you don't want to say

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
so.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
So let me go back a little. I'm one of the

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
reasons for my extra Oh was that I had and I said

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
which I never knew about that for you and

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
me. Basically it's an auto immune disease which causes

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
me to take in and that's causing a stroke. Then

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
moving forward there's a twenty percent chance of people with

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
it and therefore also have Lupus. So

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
so I don't know why it was lupus suspect

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
did it wasn't confirmed till a few years later

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
but I don't see what is happening.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
So where do you have to stay on steroids all the time

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
so intimately I gained on steroids a bit of

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
settling for the first few years I would be on

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
steroids for me like six months or so and then I'd be

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
OK for another six months and then go back on and stuff. The

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
last time I was on heavy doses of steroids

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
for a good year but that was three years ago and

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
haven't been since. But you know it's just a

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
matter of time.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Yet I didn't say or keep but

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
how do you maintain it.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
OK do you. Know.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
I have always found it very very you know that

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
for us there right now.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Yeah yeah. I've always been that way.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
I was always like a person like I would always

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
I wasn't like oh this like of course it all sucks

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
you know and I mean there's no thing about it but I'm not a person to

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
be like oh for me you know you know I don't

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
look at everybody look at me. Help me out you know just more like I

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
gotta do what I gotta do when I do I like being independent

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
and things like that and so you know I just go about

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
my weight you know. And if people don't like it they don't like it and I mean

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
you know and whatever you know. So I try

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
my hardest to do things and you know like every once in a while I go

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
through occupational therapy and stuff which helps out a little. You know

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
this is not a miracle cure or anything you know.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
So yeah so.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
When Morris the hardest task challenges

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
you faced and how did you get through them

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
. It's

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000
like physically

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
The only way it was just like a question of like

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
getting things done it took me longer to do

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
today. And look I think you know

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
first it was like kind of scary to go on the

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
subway by myself and stuff like that.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
But more so. In my

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
mind then things like that. So initially after the stroke

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
I have to move back in with my dad for a year

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
and even after a year if that's what I like was like

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
moving back in there. Living alone you know when you fly do you really

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
think you can live alone and I was like I'm not sure but I gotta

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
try and stuff like that. And so yeah I work out and

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
stuff but you know it was like a big process like in the wake of like

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
you know me and my dad had a discussion you know it's like.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Well let's just say you know do you know

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
do you really want to rent a place like you know and

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
so like I was like yes I would love to own both what if I can't

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
live by myself and then you know and then he was like.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
OK so you don't buy a place but I mean if you

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
can't live by yourself then you want to rent it out and you

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
know back home but then it was like you and your co-author condo I mean it

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
was like well if you can only stay there and you want to get out then you

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
need to get a condo vs

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
. Oh you know it was all these discussions. Then

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000
it's a financial issue. Everything said you know you

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
dig up.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
I've got no condo. Yeah. So because I wasn't sure if I could

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
really live alone you know what it can live right now

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
and then the other thing was like. OK So if you're going to move me you gotta know

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
like I used to live. In a lock up.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
And I couldn't live there anymore so you know I was like

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Yeah you know it was like I need it

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
going on but I needed assistance a lot of assistance so I needed

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
to be in a false and doing stuff like you know who will or

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
if anything happens I'm fairly comfortable

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
and fairly sing you know and stuff you know see

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
how you are in a leadership role and you know.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Yes on my condo board. Far

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
are you. I'm on the board of Sydney. Yeah you know so

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
well are.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
You going to my condo board or.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Anyone else likes the flick like

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
I would say seventy years at least and I think on this board

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
have been released five years or so that you get on

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
me for that hey so if you want.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Yeah no no that's fine. So after I had my stroke and

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
everything but before I went back to school I

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
was probably like year two I guess

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
I am I. One

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
tear for him for some wine

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
bottles Carlos is society.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
And I got that mom that said at the time which was like of the

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
hand assistants and stuff like that so they're

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
like you know work part time. You see

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
what you can do you know things like that and so I

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
volunteered in the legal. Department and the

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Multiple Sclerosis Society in New York and I met

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
my friend right now. It's my boss at that time

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
and she is on the board of me

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
and so did her.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
I mean there are times when I see her.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Yes so what.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
So I was going to offer you as you many questions like

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
can you tell me I'm an experiencer to bring you the word

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
turban too and not let the stuff you already

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
read it didn't even think about it but he used

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
the word stop right to your day to day did

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
you have a time when you had paused to

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
work to even think about it you

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
know what I think is going on buses

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
a lot of money issues at first for like the first

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
couple years was like.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
It's like OK so I'm disable and I'm

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
entitled to sit in the disabled spots but

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
it's like where people look at me really funny

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
and stuff like that and I just like and I think that you know I

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
felt bad for sitting there and stuff like in my own mind goes like

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
do I really do I get up and let somebody else

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
take this you know and and so it's been a struggle but

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
you know like I'm more comfortable now and people

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
will approach me and be like why do you sing the you know the

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
light and sometimes I got up and then they'd be like oh yeah you know who it

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
is they're you know and you know who have been getting it right

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
now I think now that I'm older too because I was only

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
twenty eight at the time and you know why younger an

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
hour already. And so you have

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
to deal with it. Yeah you know a long time.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Yeah I. Know you've heard things change. In

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
addition to that with your friends or family

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
or community have handled things

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
evolve.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
At first it was everybody was like

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
hovering over you like everyone kind of like

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
just wants to protect you but you know

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
you know there's only there's only room for so long people can do that.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
As much as they want to but you know it's like it's not like

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
they can do that for a year and then you know and then

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
that's what it ends up happening everybody wants to protect you and make

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
sure you don't like have any ill feelings and stuff like that but

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
you know as time goes on you're going to have to realize that you do

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
have to deal with it a lot in everything when they're not around.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Right right and so you know it's so I am a person who is just

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
like I'm going to live as you know. Because you're not going

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
to change my personality or anything you know

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
. And as much as I like people like my family would love to

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
love to see me more are you know not as I once am I have

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.000
spoken

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
. But a person.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Tells it as it is. Basically I'm not like I'm

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
not a very real talk about person. But if I'm

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
interested I'll say what I need to say

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
I think you're quite OK.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
How so and you know you had a stroke.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Many years ago now. So what experience

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Do you have right now do you feel like

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
you are in the display community or have you

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
program for a year now and I still think the

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Liddy community because one physically because of my

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
stroke but also because of Lucas so I've kind of you know like

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
and looked as I say I don't know if it's technically a disability

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
or not and in cases it might not be and in other cases it

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:13.000
might be going on.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
There's always concern in my mind like there's always going to be

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
something you know. Yes I feel fine today but that

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
could change at any point.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
You know and so I'm

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
in my mind I see myself as disabled because there are

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
certain things I can't do stuff like that but you

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
know. Other times you know

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
I'm more comfortable now saying I am disabled and I am you

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
know it took me a while to be OK with being

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
a disabled person but you know it just it wasn't like a

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
given day here on Earth would be like to have any or

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
anything but it just you know it took me time to you know

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
come to terms with everything.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Hell are you asking for help.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Prior to fly home I do ask for help when I

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
need to but I try to do it for

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
myself. A few different times and then if I really

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
can't then I ask for help. So how are you with

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
people offering you help. So it's really funny you know.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
So I met this so I wasn't dating for a really

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
long time after the stroke and I was like

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
not in the mood for anything. And. I

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
saw this guy on the street looking at me and I was just like forever

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
and so and then he kind of looked back

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
at me and came up to teens like Are you OK and I was like yeah I'm

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000
fine.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
He was like Can I walk you somewhere and we were right outside of my

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
building and so I was like I live here. No you know

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
and he was like.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Do you want to go somewhere or you can use like you

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
want to go get a drink or something and I was like why would I go you know it's

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
like I don't know you. And.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Yes why not. You know and that was like a moment in my

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000
mind where it was lying. I really couldn't

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000
answer him. I really didn't have.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
An answer to him and so then you know I went with him and whatever

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
he we became friends and and it was just like

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
kind of like a stretch.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Yeah it was just like a slave and nothing major but you know it

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
was just like he goes long enough you know and that was

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
just in my mind it just was like oh yeah it

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
is interesting because you were always taught since

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
childhood to go and you know I think I

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
hate it I mean I and then I mean sure I

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
was you know it. Yeah yeah.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
And I didn't let him get into my apartment. Haris Yeah

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
yeah.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
OK he has don't you find it yet. Oh I know

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
because I was going to bring up. OK OK so very

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000
different way here.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Very difficult but you know

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
I do mean anyone are

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
like so from two thousand and

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
one to maybe two thousand and

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
eleven. So you know that's a long time

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah. And so you

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
know and then then I started dating a little

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
on line and everything but I'm

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
OK You know this is you know I was dating a little bit online

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
. I met someone.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
You know and he's very interesting. But it just never

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
really worked out and stuff.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Do you tell me before that

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
you had to deal with that.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
I so I did and you know I had it on my profile listen

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
I'm not one of the person who.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
It's not that I'm very upfront about it but like

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
dating I just felt like they should know like I don't want to have to

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
kind of beat around the bush with anything so I just put it

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
out there you know and if they have a problem with that they have a

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
problem with that you know. Yeah so yeah. But then

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
you know a lot of people ask a lot of questions

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
about it. And in some ways that's fine but that in other ways

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
it's like why did it really matter.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
You know you know like you know so

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
yeah

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
. So. Why do you

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
think they do. Right.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
There you go out by the very last page

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
and I say I don't know dating someone who

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
didn't really have a disability but he well

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
he went through.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
He had some

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
kind of medical issue and stuff and it's only really

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
to make you

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000
.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Do something. Yeah that's right yeah. And so you know we

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
relate it to it and it's. Why yes but I can't

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
believe I mean we just casually nothing like me

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
. And then I did a little bit more time. There

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
are scammers on line and everything and so you know it kind of did it for

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
a year but then it never really came to fruition it was more like

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
talking to people on the phone but actually physically meeting I don't know

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
if it really worked out you know and then and then you know

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
talking online I mean talking over the phone and everything. After a

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
while they forget about my disability which is

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
great but then when we me they're lying confronted with

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
this all over again and so it's like what do it do

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
and it's all about me it was kind of nice when I saw that guy on the

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
street and then I mean he came in my mind it

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
was like oh right i was like OK so maybe it's better for me not to be

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
online and just me. People went on about you know

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
sex and yeah but you know you know Dating is

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:14.000
hard.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Can I just ask you why it didn't work out

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000
was presented to you. As a success. Let me tell you

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:29.000
why. They didn't have any taint what it

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
is now.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Yeah yeah I think yeah I think once you mean the

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
right person I don't think the

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
disability go away you know

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
and you know like they know your

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
condition and everything and they accommodate that so the disability

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
part of it will always be an issue but

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
the relationship doesn't you know change in the light. Like

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
when I met the guy on the street it was like.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
So you know like when you meet me in general now it's more

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
closer to me like within like a year for three years as

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
opposed to going you know closer to where he

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
lives or wherever you know. But other than

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
that the reason you know that he's a cop.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Yeah yeah and yeah OK so

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
yeah but you know like you know like I said I don't let anybody

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
stop me doing what I do you know. And so like

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
for example I went to I go to the U.S. Open once a

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
year and everything and so. I don't usually go

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
in but I can't really walk around so I usually get the

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
results here it takes me to the sea and then

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
they you know after it's all done they take me and drop me off at the

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000
entrance to the U.S.T.A. and then you know it's

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000
like yeah you know like celebrity you know no but you

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
know it's like.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
I think I did walk in. The first

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000
year and it just was really tiring for me and so

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
then like and then like the next couple of years I kind of

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
try to avoid trying to go in and just do

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
like one. Just like just to go one place

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
you know and it took me a couple of years to be like

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
OK All right. Yeah and

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000
you write on vacations. Yeah yeah and

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
so yeah when I go on vacation I go with a couple of girlfriends and

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
stuff and they're all walking in everything. I get a

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
scooter. So you know I don't like so for

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
my fortieth birthday we were in Miami and they could all

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
walk around and stuff

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
. I guess that aren't so I could just be with them you know and then I

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
had to give you know my walking is

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
incredibly slow so you know like come.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Like walking down the block takes me like a minute or two as opposed to

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
most people just like me.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Yeah OK Well yeah. It

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
sounds to me like you. Right right right

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000
right right

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
. Yeah but I mean you know I do. Over the years I

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
tend not to use the subways.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.000
I mean I do it at times when I need to run stuff but I don't in

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
general I will prefer the buses over subway

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000
cars going up and down the stairs is a lot because of my stroke

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000
and because of my lupus their tires me out.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000
It's hard you know it's hard to go down the stairs

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
. I don't have a problem go up stairs down the stairs is but you

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000
know it's just like I think you know and so I didn't

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.000
go home in the subway like you know a few times you

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000
know but you know after all.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Not on the subway stairs but I didn't

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000
fall on the street once or twice since that way.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Especially when I was on steroids and stuff you

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:11.000
know.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Yeah yeah yeah it happens you know it could happen to anybody.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Yeah yeah yeah all right.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Yeah and it happens because

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
I'm cautious unconscious so yeah

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000
I sound like you know you're I mean yeah yeah

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000
yeah. Is that part of the acceptance because

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
maybe. Yeah I think so. You know

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
so I have this and I get extremely tired at times

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
because of it and I plan on schedule and I

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000
do things but I try not to make my

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
schedule and pack you know everything in one day or anything.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
So I try to like be like I try to say like in my mind I'm not going to

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
do more than two activities a day and then even then

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
I you know I really try to plan like one day where I have

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000
nothing to do. Like somebody like have a day where

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000
I'm water in my one class

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000
. So yeah you're

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
like oh. Yeah yeah you know

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
because you know on some days it's like I'm just so tired you know

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
. So I don't really need to wait just a day just to do

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
nothing and went day in and rested

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
. Yeah yeah OK So

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000
listen I hear bucket list I'm thinking I don't know maybe

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000
you checked some of them off or

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000
run off or you know and I knew I would like to

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
travel a little bit more.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Where. All human hands. Yeah you know I'm going

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
to you know but I want to go like I would love to

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000
do a trip to Europe again and to other places

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000
that I haven't been you know where are the other places on

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000
I think I slept soundly and Paris.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000
I would love to go to

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Asia or you know I've been to India you know but I don't want to go to like

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Thailand or China or something.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000
So yeah I can connect so

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:07.000
well and so I would love to hear places

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000
you like to go to.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
OK I'm sorry. I forgot to ask you about

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:16.000
tearing

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:20.000
. Oh yeah yeah and so you say

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000
interesting. Yeah. So as I said I was a lawyer

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000
and after I stopped working after

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000
getting my masters I still wanted to do

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000
well here in things and so

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
one day I was home watching Dr Phil of all things

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.000
which I don't really like but he

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.000
he talked about Casa or witches.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.000
It was basically to volunteer for kids in the foster

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.000
care system in color and kind of her

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
that kind of interested me and so you know I applied

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000
for CASA CASA is short for a court appointed special

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000
ed kids and so on.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.000
So I applied and they went through their training and everything

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.000
and now I volunteer for kids in the foster care system in court

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
which I really like because I used to love going to court and being very

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000
caging for people who

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:48.000
are again there are more kids usually I

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:53.000
don't know much but usually when the judge

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000
the attorneys the caseworkers and

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000
everybody I don't know what you did to the child

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000
at times you do see. I've definitely seen

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000
parents and I've times I've met the kids

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000
but they're not usually here in Port and a lot of the

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:22.000
stuff that I do I can do from home so it's a lot of phone

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
calls and making sure people get things done. So

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
the court assigns us these cases

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000
and it's little we kind of so you know

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000
like the case workers have their own perspective the attorneys have their own

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000
perspective and so because it is kind of like where we

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.000
can kind of see a whole picture kind of like the eyes and

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000
ears of the court and so on.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.000
You know it's like we call and follow up on all of these to make

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000
sure everything has to be done you know where it is you know OK

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000
so this is look this is all I can do you know and then turning I'll just say

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000
that's not my goal though it's kind of like bridging the

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.000
gap between so

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:22.000
do you find it every morning.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Very well you know what are.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.000
I like being active I like the fact that

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000
People can rely on me you know I mean I don't do much

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:41.000
but you know like it's nice talking to whoever it is and they

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:46.000
like want to get information and and and or

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.000
they're a person who can't really get that information and it's very important for

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000
me to get that information and get it out there for them and stuff like

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
that.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Yeah and it's very rewarding when you know I see

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000
am I here.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:12.000
Case closed for a while ago but he ended up

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
he was in foster care and he ended

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
up being adopted by foster parents and stuff like that and I was

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.000
there things that were in their.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Hands or a tactic.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Yeah well maybe but you know the other thing I

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000
really like about it is that it isn't my case.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:44.000
But I also have a supervisor and any time that I

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.000
get sick or if I can't do anything it's going to conquer

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:54.000
everything and so it's like you know for me that's very

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:58.000
helpful because there are times when you know

00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.000
.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.000
You know I get sick and I can't do you know and I'm not

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
as effective and stuff like that so it's really good to have the back up you

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.000
know. Yes sorry. Yeah it's very reassuring. And it's not like

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.000
we're And all of us. It's nice to be part of an organization

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000
where you know. You can do that you know and

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.000
it's not something that's like a full

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000
time job or anything so I get like two or three cases a time so it's like

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.000
you know ends up to be like five to ten hours you know for something

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.000
so yeah it's just right for you

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.000
. Yeah yeah.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Sounds like you have so much more time on

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:56.000
the board and see me and so I feel like between those things and

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000
it's you know it's a good mix and it's also like my

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
like illegal things I do cause

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.000
things like my condo work because I live in that community and it's very fulfilling to

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:18.000
me and for Sydney it's like I try to raise

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000
funds and stuff like that so yeah

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:23.000
yeah.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000
There advocate for the disabled.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Yeah and you do you stay in touch with

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000
your all that or oh yeah

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.000
yeah yeah I mean there are some that I lost you know like

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.000
it's just I'm you know not being in touch and stuff but

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.000
in general yeah OK. Yeah and that happens that

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:55.000
everyone you know disabled or not you know

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:01.000
but I've lost very few friends because I'm disabled

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000
but your personality Yeah I have

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:10.000
gained a lot of more friends and I have very

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.000
good friends from growing up in a big thing and then have

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.000
a few college friends and everything

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:22.000
and you know.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.000
I guess the biggest part of losing was

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000
. More of my law school friends

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.000
. That's a question of the way just

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:42.000
because I don't More

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000
own work related you know.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000
So I'm not really in that. You know. Are you here

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:55.000
. Yes. But I do have I have

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.000
friends that I used to work with that are very good friends

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:04.000
. So so people lawyers

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.000
like my own old office need an old

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.000
office around people that I used to hang out with after work and

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:20.000
though they are still good friends and until and we still go

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:24.000
out to eat or whatever come to their marriages and

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000
stuff like that yeah yeah.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Yeah yeah.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.000
So anything else you want to stay

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000
for your experience. It's their partner.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:50.000
It sucks to be disabled. Oh it's no fun

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:54.000
but I also think that getting

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000
past it is all in the mindset you know it's like

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
you can be a miserable person where you can do something about it

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
and I've always been a person who is like I'm going to do something about

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
it here now instead of just being poor.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:18.000
You know from the get go yeah yeah Hear

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
hear. And did you have any new role models to know

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
how you know on the railroad. Any support.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I'm sure I did. Yeah it was a while ago.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I'm you know I mean I think that person has

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000
The Multiple Sclerosis Society was a very good role model for me

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
and you know you saw her with her

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.000
disability and stuff like that and I

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
respect her tremendously and stuff like that

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And you know I think

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
you know in talking to friends and family and stuff it's

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
just being normal just talk you know and I

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
don't want to try to make it so. There was

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
nothing they shouldn't talk about you know. So like a lot of people end

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
up like I don't want to be like Let's talk

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
about her disability but not in front of her or anything like that.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Yeah yeah I like that. Yes I was just

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
like come on now ask whatever you want you know.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.000
But times you know some people you know

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:55.000
tend to talk too much and they're like OK heroic stuff

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
you know and stuff.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Yeah. OK so.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Are you selling yourself in

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
T.V. or do you really

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:17.000
.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Think you so much for the interview.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
You know OK I found more things.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Speaking as a single person myself

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
I'm curious to know I think you're steaming

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
interested meaning

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.000
somebody yeah but. How do you deal with

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
me so far right then and go

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Oh yeah yeah yeah. Answer part of me is fun

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
to go on but I don't work I love to know

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000
how you deal with kissing me. Well

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000
yeah let him leave already.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
So you know as I

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
said before dating is very awkward at first and everything

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
just saying I have no issues with all of that I am a person who

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
loves kissing and and and you know I

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:39.000
think of you know the writing how to have

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
less

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
. Right.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Exactly but you know

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:51.000
getting more intently is very awkward. And

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
I'm still not very good at it

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
You know and honestly it took me

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000
from two thousand and one and two

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.000
last year.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Right did not have sex whatsoever. But I did

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000
have times when you know we fooled around and

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.000
stuff like that but we didn't actually have physical

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
sex. And. And

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.000
since last year I've had a few times

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
but it's still a little

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000
awkward to me in the way and really in the way

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
I like different positions and

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
stuff I really can do a lot in that it's like

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
you know it's like OK the guy who have to be on top of me.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Yeah yeah yeah and they were right happening

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
. They do yeah well you

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
know and.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
First. Partner I had he was very

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
good and in the way he was disabled

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
also very different than me so it wasn't a

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000
physical Well it was you know but he

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:37.000
was more on the line now you know so it was in

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
position ing things you know but it also

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
that first time he made me feel good about it in the

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
way like OK this is normal you know and so

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000
yeah yeah and so on. And since then

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
you know I'm here and still

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:11.000
you know depends on the different people you know and you know

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
so I still don't have them

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:22.000
. I still don't have a

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
lot of.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Some the sex that I've had it's only on

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
occasion and then we're going to be with the same person like maybe like

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000
two or three times and then they just dissipates and so I'm

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
still not good in

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
having a good

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
sexual longterm

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000
person so I'm still struggling with

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
. Well I mean as for

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:08.000
it being so many who will be right for you right away

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
and said oh you know but it has to.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Did you break up because you know it's not going to break up or

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I think it's just it's just yet because it

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
wasn't like.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
We were dating to begin with. You know it was more

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
like. You know we're having fun when we when we

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
go out. For a couple of times but it's not like

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000
he wanted to get up to be my boyfriend or anything. So yeah

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
there was.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Yes you're right and I am and

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
I still struggle with the real

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.000
intimacy of you know the relationship and everything

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000
And so he does or now

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
I just lanky in my mind set

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
and just being physically intimate and alone.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Yes I would love that with you know so people but it's just not

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:28.000
happening and so I have to struggle with that reality

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
you know.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
But I'm hopeful you know

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
. Right right right

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
. Well you know yes so that's something that I've

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
definitely.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Struggled with. That you know if you're not lying

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000
to your wife to do it.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Yourself. Right. Yes but I mean I still

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:02.000
feel awkward. You know what I mean. I just I don't know.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
How too late do it now I mean I've

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:13.000
had sex and stuff like that but it's like I just don't know

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000
how to work on how to

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000
pursue a relationship

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.000
along to please him you know

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000
because.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
But it is that because of your spelling or is

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
not really.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Having much it yeah I mean

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000
you know it's not anything to do with the disability but it it's always come

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
down when the.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Yeah I mean I think it's more in general just

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:02.000
meeting the right person and stuff. Yeah yeah

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000
