00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hello listeners. My name is Tenisha Urena and I'm going to have a conversation with Adrian Wagner for

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Visible Lives an our history project at the New York Public Library is not one thousand

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
2014 and this is being recorded at 55 West 13th, ah, Street Manhattan

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Manhattan New York. It's a pleasure to meet you, Adrian.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Thank you. It's nice to meet you. Um, okay, so I guess we'll just jump

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
right into it. Uh,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
tell me about where you're from. Uh, I'm from North Carolina in a

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I grew up outside of a small town called Hillsborough, North Carolina

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which is just as rural as it sounds, um, and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I grew up across the street from a tobacco field

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and, uh, it was kind of just like my

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
parents, my sister, and myself,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And, uh, you know, we lived pretty

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
far outside of town, like... it, it took 30 minutes to, uh,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
drive in to get groceries or anything. So, I'd say it was like a pretty isolated

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
upbringing, in a way. I mean I was either,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
at least for the first part of my life, I was either at school or with

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
my parents, you know. Not a lot of time in between.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
When did your experiences, uh, with disability start and can you explain what it is?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Sure.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Sure. Uh... so actually it's

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I...

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I suspect now that it began before this, but,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
it just... it started to really affect me when I was 12

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
years old. Uh, I have a visual impairment

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
uh, but I- I didn't know that when I was 12

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and no one else really did either. I was kind of like,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I was kind of a, like, baseball star

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And, My father and I were

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
going out to play catch in the backyard one day,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And, the weirdest thing happened!

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And I thought I was crazy the first few times it happened.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And what that was was--he would throw this baseball

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and then it would just disappear. You know, it was, like, I would see it in his hand he would

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
throw it and then it was gone. And that was troubling for a lot of reasons

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
reasons. Mostly because I was, being

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Being like, hit with this baseball [Tenisha laughs] that was just, like, disappearing

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
[Tenisha laughs] Um,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
so, I- I said to my father, like, "Hey, I can't s- I can't see the ball!" You know?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and he was asking me, like, "What's wrong with you?" Like, "Catch it," you know, "What's going on?"

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So, I- I talked to him about this and I talked to my mother about this and they said well, you know maybe you need

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
glasses, whatever, so they took me to LensCrafters... in the mall...

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and, uh, they did various tests like, you know, "Tell me what

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
this looks like. Alright, tell me now. Tell me now. Tell me now" and... it really didn't

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
make any difference to me what they did, you know, it all kind of looked... the same.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and... at the end

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the... optometrist from LensCrafters told my mother

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that I was... that I was doing something like I was, I was trying to

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
pull some stunt to, like, get out of playing baseball or get out of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
doing schoolwork or like there was... something that I was trying to get out of

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
pretending to not be able to see. And luckily,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
my mother,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Being the woman that she is, believed me

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
enough to not believe the optometrist and take [sic] me to a

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
specialist... where, um... they found out through

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Rigorous testing that I have this form of

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
macular degeneration known as Stargardt's Disease.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Usually macu--Macular degeneration affects older people. But

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Stargardt's Disease is like a younger, um, onset

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
um, and it's a disease that affects... the...

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
macula, uh, inside of the retina, which is like

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
where you process light, um,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Which is why for me, it sort of looks like all the

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
time like I just looked into really bright light--And if I

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
look away-or-I mean- if you if you look away after you look into really bright light you know there's like that

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
big, like, spot there and that's what it looks like me, uh, looks like for me

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.000
all the time.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Uh, so, that happened I was 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
12 and they... they told me and my parents

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
some things were going to change probably but they didn't know when and they didn't know how much

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and there wasn't really th- a lot that they could... really do about it.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Um, So they kind of just sent us home wondering. And I

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
think my sister says it the best when she says, you know, "We all knew that we were supposed to be

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
sad about something, but we didn't exactly know what it was."

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Um, and it didn't really bother me until

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
um, my--

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
my... 16th birthday.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
My [laughter] and we're going to we're going to get pretty intimate, pretty fast [more laughter].

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
but, you know, you have to. Um, my sixteenth birthday my father, like, came up

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
came up stairs while I was sitting in my room and, uh,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
he came in and he was- he was, like, crying, you know, and

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
He- he said, you know, "This car that I, that I

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
bought... when... uh, you were you were

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
11" and it was, like, this beautiful car. He said, "This car

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that I bought, you know, I bought it... to give to you when you were 16

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and I can't give it to you now because you can't drive."

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And, uh, that, you know

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
It was weird... for me because I felt like...

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I was comforting him more than he was comforting me

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and that's sort of the relationship I've always had with my parents, like,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
in terms of, like, visual

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
accommodations and... emotional accommodations, like,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
...they...

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
don't... really know what to do... and have never really known what to do.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So, um, as this

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
thing sort of progressed. I mean, it's been, it's been largely up to me

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
me to, like, figure out... what... uh

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
I can do about it. I mean how to do... work.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and, um, it seemed pretty logical that I would become

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
a musician because I guess that's just like what blind people

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
do. Um, [chuckle] so, I started doing that

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
um, and I started doing some sound-

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
related things... uh, and then...

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I don't know... I-

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I actually did a lot of things, uh, I don't know how in-depth this

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
... this interview should go on... I guess it's up to me to

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
decide that. [Tenisha chuckles] But, I mean, I- I did some

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
things that, like, I don't think blind people necessarily do traditionally

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
like, I worked for the Park Service [Okay] uh, for a long time, for 3

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
years and I- I went out to Texas and did trail construction out there

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and went to Colorado and did the same thing there and went to 

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Vermont and did the same thing there

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Um, and I- you know

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
well that time I... would go back home when I wasn't doing that and I would in two and then I would play

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
with a band that I was performing with and, um, you know

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
it's kind of, like, a little pop outfit because we were, like, in high school and [Tenisha chuckles] just thought it was

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
cool. Um, but then I went to college and that sort

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
of ended in a friend introduced me to rock climbing and I

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
kept doing the music but I couldn't read music really well

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I- I mean I could but I couldn't, like, sight read and play at the

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
same time. I would have to read it, memorize it, and then play it back so I couldn't go to music

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
school. Um, but I did get into college and a friend

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
showed me, like, rock climbing... and,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
you know, you'd be surprised how little rock climbing has to do with seeing

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
[Tenisha chuckles] You know, it's more about feeling. I mean, the idea of being like 3,000 feet in

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
the air [You would think] and not, like, not looking

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
where you are. I mean... uh, some people might

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
consider that problematic [Tenisha chuckles], you know, but I just never really thought about

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
that. It just seemed like fun, you know?

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So... I started, um, I started acting

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
while I was in college because it didn't really seem to make a lot of sense to

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
um, I don't know, to do anything

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
but that, really. I- to do, like, math or science or anything

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
um, so I- I started acting and directing

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
because I found that it was kind of the right

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
mix of, like, something physical and...

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
um.... something mental.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And... I, uh,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
graduated from college... and...

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
moved up to D.C. where

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I started acting... and I quickly found that that was, like,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
a pretty difficult thing to do if you- if you can't see because

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
people will ask you to do so many, like, cold readings and stuff. And you walk in

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and they hand you a sheet of paper where the text is too small and you say, like, "I can't read this!" and they say,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
"Well, get out!" [chuckles] You know? [Ohh.]

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Uh, I mean... it doesn't really matter to them, like, they have a lot of people to choose from [Right.] but,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
but -and- and I'm not saying it's, like, a sob story, I'm just saying, like, you gotta, you gotta think about these things

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
so, it didn't... it didn't really make a lot of sense that

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I would keep doing that. Though... I did it for a year and, uh,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
I wasn't terrible. You know, I did some plays and I directed a couple

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
things, um, and

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Uh, I don't know in that time I had

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
written- I had written, recorded, produced, uh, a few

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
albums, um, and I was working on a movie

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
with a friend of mine one day and it was sort of like the last thing I had lined

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
up for the year and I went outside to make a phone call or

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
something and my phone rang and it was a friend of mine and he said, "Hey man," you know, "I'm working on

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
this cruise ship workin' in this cruise ship band... and half the band got fired,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
look, we need you on Thursday for six months. And... we're going to

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Australia and [Tenisha chuckles] you're gonna love it, just, you know, pack up your life and get on this boat

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
So... I- I thought that sounded like a pretty good idea and the

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
movie... shoot was ending on Tuesday so I, you know, I had 2 days to get it together

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and fly out to Vancouver and meet the ship and... and go to Au- Australia

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
which I did and that was a total... adventure. We

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
left, uh, from Vancouver, Canada and went down to Hawaii

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and then down to... Tahiti and Bora Bora and

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
which are, like, all in uh French Polynesia, a place that

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I still could not point to

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
on a map [Tenisha chuckles] and, uh,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Yeah... It w- I dunno it was really cool

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
um, and

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
went... uh

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
from- from there over to New Zealand and up to Australia

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
around Australia and up to South Asia

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
um, and then I did the cruise ship gig

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
for... another year... after that.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Until it sort of started to seem like I was hiding... on a cruise

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
ship, you know. It wasn't really doing anything for my career... and

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I didn't really see it... going anywhere long term, you know. You see these guys that were on a cruise

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
ship like 50-year-old guys, you know, playing, like, the same Billy Joel

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
song that they've been playing for the last 30 years [Tenisha chuckles] except every time they

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
play it they play it, like, a little bit worse. [Mm-hmm chuckle] You know, so I

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
thought that that probably wasn't for me.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And I... came back and I

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I thought, well,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
you know, "What the fuck do I do now?" [Tenisha chuckles] um, and I was in

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
North Carolina and, uh, the good thing was that I- I had a lot of money

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
because I had just spent all this time on a cruise ship and there's no expenses at all

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
like, you live there for free for free... you eat for free...

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
you, I- I mean pretty much all expenses paid. The flight over there is free

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
The flight back is free... [Tenisha:Nice.] It's pretty cool, um, so...

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I had that, you know, and that was that was a luxury that, um,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
made... my move to New York possible.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Um, I had always wanted to live in New York.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
but... I... also was like, afraid of living in

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
New York because there's such a stigma around it. You know, people

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
say, like uh, "New York, it's a hard town!" you know they, they - and all [Tenisha chuckles] this stuff. Th-There's

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that saying like... uh, "Live in New York but not so long that it

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
makes you, makes you hard, like, "Live in California but not so long

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
that it makes you soft." Um, and...

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
that... I don't know. It's- it's so 

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
weird. I- I think New York is, like, the most narcissistic city... in the

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
world. Like. It's- It's the media capital

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
or the self-proclaimed media capital of the world. They, like, put out all this media

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
about New York, it's like, "New York this. New York this." Like, everybody needs to know

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
about New York but when you come here, like, in a lot of ways

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
it's not really that different from, like, a small town

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
um, in North Carolina, like, it's just...

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
150 small towns all, like, bunched together

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
but really, like, I think that all of the same things happen

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
but, um, but that being said, like, it does take some getting used to

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
obviously and I got here.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And I, um, found an apartment, you know, I did the, like,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
bring- or- move to New York with a backpack and look

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
around for an apartment and find one that night [Oh wow]

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
[Tenisha: Oh wow.] kinda deal. Um, yeah, so, I found one out in Ridgewood, um,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Queens, which is like, it's fine looking back

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Um, there was, like, I don't know... some gang stuff but, like, whatever

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
there's gang stuff everywhere, um. So I

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
moved in with this, uh, Australian guy... kind of ironically, you know, since I'd

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
just, like, gotten back from there. [Tenisha chuckles] And, uh, the next day I was like,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
"Alright, I'm feelin' good. Got an apartment. Now I need a job."

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Um, so, "What do I do?" And I sort of like... walked out the door with the same

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
sort of mentality like I'd gotten my apartment with, you know, like "Gotta come back

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
ton-... home tonight.... employed. Like, I have to work somewhere

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
sort of walked around and I was looking at, like, hot dog stands

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
like, "Man, I could work at a hot dog stand!" [Tenisha chuckles] "...or, oh, there's a CVS!"

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
...or, "There's , there's a restaurant! I could be a waiter!" You know and then I

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
was thinking about it and was like, "No... I couldn't really be a waiter. No, I don't really wanna work at

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
a hot dog stand. No, I... I can't use a cash

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
register... is, is one of my biggest problems and I'm sort of just, like, walking

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
through the city and narrowing down, like, what I can and can't do

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Something I probably should have done like years before that.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
and... eventually day turns to night and I end

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
up at this bar in Bushwick called Goodbye Blue Monday's.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
which is, like, a old, kind of like punk bar, I guess, when they were

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
They were having this open mic night and it was the most godawful thing I'd ever seen

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
[Tenisha laughs] in my entire life. Like, these, these co- players were like... so

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
bad. I mean it's a-like an intentional freak show, if you ever go there and if it's still open, if they haven't

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
like, shut it down for like gross [Tenisha chuckles] misconduct

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
of, uh, like violation of health code [Tenisha laughs]

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
or whatever... Um, but it's k-, you know, it's kind of an interesting place

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Anyway, so I'm sitting there at the bar... um, watching

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
these, uh, performers

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
and I start talking to this guy next to me who, wh-, who doesn't

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
really seem like he fits into, like, the scene. You know, he's not a hipster

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
he's in his 40s or something.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Actually, he was like totally wasted. Uh, [Tenisha chuckles] and he was

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
actually kind of annoying in a way but eh, I don't know. We were just talking

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
and whatever and it was, like, my second night in New York so

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
I... I was willing to talk to anybody. I mean, I didn't have any friends up here

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
um, and, we got to talking

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
about, like, work at some point and I was telling him how

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
you know, I had sent out of a- a few emails today about, like, looking for work

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
and walked around and dropped resumes off at a lot of places and I had actually

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
like, gotten a job working at this Irish pub

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
but it would, it would have taken me, like, an hour to get there

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
um, every day, you know, it's like in Park

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Slope. Would, uh, I would've had to, like, transfer trains and rely on the

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
G and all this stuff, like, all the things you're not supposed to do [Tenisha chuckles. "Right."]

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Yeah, and uh, he said

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
"Man, you're lookin' for work? Well I'll tell you what.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
I got a job for you... and this is where it is. And

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
I'll see you... 9 o'clock in the morning," and, uh

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
then he left. And... he left me with the address.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
and he, he-he didn't tell me, you know, what the job was

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Um, but I did kind

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
of figure from like his... demeanor that uh he wasn't really like the

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
office worker type so I wasn't really, like, worried about, like, wearing a suit or something to

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
this. And the next day, I, after you know looking up where this

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
place was I went down and it was this huge house, um, like

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
just enormous mansion on the corner Bushwick Avenue

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
you know, and uh and Gates Avenue in, um,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I guess that's like the line between Bed-Stuy and

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Bushwick and I guess I, I knocked on the door or rang the doorbell or something and

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
he came out and he said, "Hey man, how you doin'? Come on in."

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
and it was a construction site, you know. So, like, this it was apparently it was a

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
a construction job which, the idea of sort of made me nervous at first

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
but you know I thought well, "Hell, I'll try anything once and twice if it didn't kill me

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
the first time." [Tenisha chuckles] Uh, so, he just started handin' me power tools

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
and tellin' me to take stuff apart and I just never really got around to

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
telling him that I couldn't see, you know, um... and

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
honestly it never was an issue, uh, amazingly.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
I mean. I think... that was largely because I spent

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
most of the time doing demolition and it didn't really matter

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
if I messed it up because that's what I was supposed to do

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
[Tenisha chuckles] Um, and uh he would

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
just leave me a set of instructions in the morning like, "Destroy this bathroom

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
um, "I'll see you in six hours," and it would take

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
6 hours to destroy the bathroom. Um, so yeah that was

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
that was a really good gig and uh, I mean, he was paying me, like,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
totally under the table

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
which was good for both of us [Mm-hmm] and he was paying me, like, $175 a day

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
and sometimes we would work for 8 hours and sometimes we'd only work for 4

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
hours you know and then he would say, "Alright, I'm tired. Go home," which, you know, I was getting

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
175 bucks for that. I I felt really good about it. So... that was sort of, like, my

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
"move to New York and get a job"

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
story and, like, I don't know that's that's kind of what

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
also helped finance, like, the rest of the time. I mean eventually

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
my my life in Ridgewood sort of fell apart. I mean it

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
was obvious that,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
like, I wasn't gonna to do construction work the rest of my life and I wasn't gonna

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
really be able to, I mean, be a contractor or something which is what

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
he wanted me to be, I mean. He wanted me to come on as, like, his assistant and learn from him

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
and and eventually, um, be, like, equal

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
to him which sounded really cool and I was excited about it and I did learn a lot but

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
it just wasn't gonna to work out and he was also a terrible alcoholic who would drink on the job and

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
you know, like, you can't tell somebody you can't direct somebody who's using a

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
jackhammer [Tenisha chuckles.] while you're, like, drunk [Right.] It's just not, like, good

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
business practice. [Not at all.] So I I had to quit that

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
um and about that same time I was starting to think

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
like I gotta get out of Ridgewood, you know. Like, my my roommate

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
also terrible alcoholic because he was a bartender

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
and we had this cat... that wasn't

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
fixed and it would, like, spray all over the place. It was it was a big mess 

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
like the apartment was really gross even though my room was nice

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
the rest of the place was... It was a mess. I would wake up and like find people passed

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
out in the kitchen and stuff. Like that honestly. So

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
. I had been. Going down to see

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
. A couple friends and it made in Park Slope Nancy

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
for my entire life spent a couple

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
months trying to figure out how to do that.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
And it did. Eventually I found like. A

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
reasonably priced place and Park which is

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
. Unbelievable I. Think.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Two blocks away from. Park. Right. Off the train.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
And. It's on the same block is the train. Runs

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
good. And then I plan to go to the new school

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000
. And they love him. And now here I am

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
But at the same time. I got

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
This gig doing like delivering pizza. Because you know I

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
needed another job after. The whole mishap with

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
the construction and stuff but I need I needed something so. I got this other

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
job that is not suitable for a person with a visual impairment

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
. But. It was kind of an adventure to

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
. Them because my thinking was well you know it's summer you know I like riding my bike

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
even though it's dangerous as hell. I'm. Like why not

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
try that. Turns out. It's an awful job. You know don't. Don't ever do

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
. That when it rains. And you still have to

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
deliver but you know a pile of pizza. And you can't see

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
. It is. Not. Very much.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Fun.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000
He don't Weirdly it work out. I mean they didn't fire me I quit

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
. Eventually because I just thought I was going to get hit by cars and I was just trying my

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
luck. You. Know really really pushing it. In. And I would

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
do stupid things. In and out of cars. And I

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
didn't wear a helmet and I didn't have like reflectors on me but I

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
didn't wear the. Orange yellow jacket. I was really asking for it

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
you know. But that's sort of how. I feel in general I can

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
. Consider myself. A

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
fatalist really and where do you sort of

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
. Believe in fate which.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Which is why what happens next. Maybe it's interesting.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Maybe it. Is I don't usually I. Would

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000
wear this monocular which is like one side of the

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
binocular you know to like see the addresses on the doors of the

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
places I was delivering pizza to. And one day. I

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
. Rang the doorbell of this place and suffering. Spared. And

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
. This guy answered the door and said hey you know what's that monocular bad

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
. And I told him. And he said well you

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
know that's quite something. Macular degeneration and you're delivering pizzas. You're an idiot

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
. I mean he was joking. So

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
. And he said well I know these people at Columbia that you should go

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
there and check it out they're doing a lot of things for stem cells for stem cell research. For

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
macular degeneration. And I hadn't really done any research about that because

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
basically since I was twelve it had been held under a rock trying to pretend that I can see.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
But you know it seems like a pretty good idea in that.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
That moment. Service delivering pizza with monocular.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
To maybe go check out. Something that they're doing at Columbia so he referred me

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
to some people who never called me back. But interested

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
. And. I just started doing a lot of research into like what's

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
going on with clinical trials so on and so forth. And I found

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
this clinical trial is happening or stem cells you know for starters disease

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
in Portland Oregon. Through this. This country

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000
. Oxford biomedical. So I called

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
him up and I said hey you know I'm kind of getting this clinical trial. Do you still need people

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
. In. Charge. And really the ideal candidate

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
young and healthy.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
So. They. Also ask me

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
. OK. We need you to come

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
here. Once a month whatever. We would fly we would pay

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
four thousand bucks for your trouble and.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
It sounds incredible. Me. Right. Yeah

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
no I mean. I'll definitely sign.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
It. And then then they said

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
OK well you know you have to get some genetic testing done being that this is a genetic disease

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
. There's that adding. Whatever that process entails and also you parents have to get

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000
genetically tested because this is a genetic disease and this is science and that's just how this

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
works.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
And I said well hold on. The thing is like.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
I'm adopted. So you know it's not just

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
is easy is saying like hey mom hey dad. Right. Can

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000
we get some. Can we get some new blood because I don't know them.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
And. I. Had never known them. And. Hadn't really

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
even cared to think about them. Until now. I

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
need. Them. So I started

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
trying to find them. For this. Clinical trial

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
. And that still sort of where I am

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
. But I'm getting further

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
. All the time and closer. It's just a matter of narrowing down

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000
. Men or

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
narrowing down. Which avenue. To

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
pursue. Because North Carolina is a closed adoption state

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
. You have to jump through a lot of hoops.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
To. Find. Your. Adoptive parents

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000
. And

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Now it's sort of interesting. I like the

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
. Investigatory journalism

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
. Or investigative journalism aspect. Of it

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000
. Because that's not sort of what I'm interested in doing anyway

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
. Yes I'm trying to do that

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
. And

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Yeah. That's. That's sort of where I am

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
. I mean. Some days I feel like it's going well. Some days I

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.000
feel like it's not going well. Right.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Now I don't know I mean I talk to. My.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Ophthalmologist and things and researchers and stuff all the time and. I'm just trying to like

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
get the truth see. If this is actually going to

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
do what I wanted to do. That's actually out there if they're actually like growing retinas in

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
petri dishes. You know. But. I'm

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
. Not really sure. You know I can't really get a straight answer from anyone and I

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
don't. Know how long it's going to be so my dilemma is

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
. Do I stick my head under a rock for another ten years and just forget about it until

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
like it comes out. Or do I. Actively try and make it happen

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
. To. Change my life

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
. And. I

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Mean. Those reasons for doing.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Both of those things. Any questions

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Very interesting thing. I.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Actually want to take you back. He's a musician. What do you play

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Bass and I play guitar and sing. And.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
I. Consider myself to be a singer

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
. Instrumentalist. Do

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
You think. That he. Thinks That.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
When. He

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:58.000
.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Can.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Sound

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.000
.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Well that's authenticity for you and

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
You also mentioned that he traveled traveled a lot. How was that. Like what was that your favorite

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
. And why

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
I think for South Koreans. It's really beautiful. We went to

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Nice.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
And we were to go through the front. And. A

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
couple of other places along the coast. And I

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
. Was sort of like. I had a big

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
crush on. The girl in a

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
cruise ship and and we had this very romantic

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:55.000
day.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
In the south of France where we did like. The super cliche things that

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.000
.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
You really should actually do if you go there like we got the bottle of wine and we

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
got to like really stinky cheese bread and we like mint.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Way out in like fun. Found this remote spot like on the coast. And

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
then. We'd also gotten these grapes. And.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
It was so interesting I learned I learned something about food and that's first of all that

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
French food is the shit. Well. But the reason

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
why.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Is because it's like it's local. And a lot of people

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
talk about like organic organic organic or organic doesn't mean anything

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
. You know. Well actually mean something. Is

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
local. So we're drinking this wine. And we're eating this cheese and we're eating

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
grapes. And it was here just things. Like the wine

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
. Tasted the same as the grapes. And the

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
grapes taste kind of the same as the cheese and you could kind of like

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
taste. Like common thread between all these things and

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
we're like. Tasting these things and talking about this and both thinking the same

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
thing.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
And it was this a beautiful sunny day. In the south of France

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
. And. We just. Didn't have a care in the world

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
. And it was just really. Lovely

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
you know and I just think back to that. And. If I could

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
do that every day for the rest. Of My Life as. Well.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Right. There's a lot more complicated than. Having a bottle of wine

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
. On a beach in the south of France. It shouldn't be but it

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:47.000
is.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Because it makes me want to have a bottle of wine.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
And. I. Swear that I

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
mean you know too vulgar for these projects. And say Oh

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
OK So you mentioned you were attending school. So what are you doing.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Money you are pursuing.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
And media studies there which is actually I met. Alex Kelly.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Who's. Used to this project and. From the media studies

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
sort of. Journalism.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
And.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Sort of podcast. Creation or radio or just audio

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
. But not really like. Mixing

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
instruments in music because. They're trying to get away

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
from it and I'm more interested in. The narrative. Long for. Storytelling

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
. So that's what I'm doing here. I'm not totally happy with the new school.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Because. I feel like

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
. It's maybe set up for people who have already

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
. Been working in that. Their field for like a long

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
time. I mean maybe they have been working in audio for a long time but. You know you see these people

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
come in they're like. Producers of T.V. shows and stuff and make

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000
them feel like they're getting more out of it than I am. Like for me I feel like I

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
still need to go out there and do it

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
. So yeah. More of a

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
story.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Is. A new school sucks don't go here. I'm just kidding

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
. Just make sure you know what you're getting into before you spend ten thousand dollars a

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000
semester.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.000
OK.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
You don't have to you know I don't. Think

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
. So

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Too. I was your experience with him here and it is going to shows and. Again

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
. We're going to play it and then. I was like

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Oh I don't know. I mean I want to stay. In the art world

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
. Because. People can make. Accommodations

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
. You know. If you're working

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
. In an office. And you like

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
have a low level job. You have to do all the

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
other. People. Don't. Want to do.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
And. That. There's no room for

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
. Individuality. But. With

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
. Music and you know in general. They're

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
. Like. You know. I don't know. I don't know how to

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
use the c. Word. And the difference of. Can you

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
do it you know what would you do you do that you know will trade.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
So. It wasn't there you know. It's everything is a

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
workable. I mean on the issue

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
. You encountered things like this. All the time

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
. And people just. I think. People know

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
different. Things. Yeah I mean it's funny to see people that

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
. Find. Him. But still. You know

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
trouble. Knowing their way around. Things and you know I think it's

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
. Not. In. Your
