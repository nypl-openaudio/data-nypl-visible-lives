00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So my name is Alex Kelly and I'm sitting here with Victor Kelli Zink.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Khaleesi [laughs] ummm, at the mayor's office for people with disabilities

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And it's January fifth two thousand and thirteen. And this is for the oral world history project

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
though the New York Public Library visible lives oral histories of the disability experience.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And were just gonna to talk a little bit about your life today.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Great well, So I wanted to start out by asking you a little bit about, tell me where you come from

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well thank you Alex, I appreciate it. Um, Alex right, not Alexandra? Alex....

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Either is fine [laughs].  Okay, okay....it's always good to see the name tags, it's easy for me to read.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.000
{ Laughs }Hum!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So, uh, where did I come from? My parents...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
uh, are both, uh, from New York, and um, my mother's

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
My father is from Queens and, I grew up in Ozone Park.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Queens which is um, close to the Rockaways, not too far from Brooklyn.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
so um, I get to like when I was growing up I had a.... best of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
both Worlds because, uh, I had the Brooklyn side and the Queens side, so I was, uh

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
pretty fortunate to have, uh, both neighborhoods to kind of understand.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
um.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So uh, where do you want me to begin? Memories from childhood

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
um, any, any early memories from your neighborhood growing up?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Yes... um, so I grew up, eh, mostly in Italian and Jewish neighborhood

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And um, I'm from Italian roots my grandparents are from, um..

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Italy, and I grew up in a great neighborhood, um, I.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I ah, I had one of the most amazing childhoods that anyone could ever have

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Um, I had lots of friends, I had a close family... we would play on the streets

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
streets of uh...

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Of a queens; uh, we would play stoop ball, stoop ball, baseball, we would play in the streets from

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Um, We'd play touch football from sewer... sewer... sewer cap to sewer cap

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Um, we would play...box ball and...we would

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
would stick ball and baseball and street hockey and...we just get...

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
would just get lost for hours and hours, um, playing, um...

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I...I often joke my kids go to camp during the summer, and my

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
my...my mother's idea of camp was go out and play, um...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So it was... it was fun, I had...had a great childhood, I went to a... Catholic school

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
school uh Nativity Blessed Virgin Mary where, um, I ended up being an altar boy

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
boy, um, mostly to get out of class, to to serve Mass

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and.. get out of math class [laughing]....um, and um,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
...close with my...my siblings and um, parents were great.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
always supportive in everything and everything I ever wanted to do. Um, so growing up in...in

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Queens was...was...was great, um it was it was rough at times...um you learn how

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
learn how to stick up for yourself um, in the old fashion way

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and...everything...everything I ever wanted or needed was there.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Tell me about your parents...

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
like....My parents.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
[missing dialogue] is tough, and is tough, she um, she always pushed me to do what...I needed to do

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
do to get things done, she always believed in me and always told me I could do great things

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and she's driving force...probably...even to this day, um, just, you know, hearing her

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I ..I often, I often.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Often wake up in the morning and think about her and look in the mirror and say good morning, uh, to my mother [laughs]

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
but she's...she's a good woman, she's...she's tough and, uh, she gave me a lot.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
lot. Um my dad...amazing guy.  Always..

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Always was ah, supportive and always there at all my baseball games...growing up um...

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
always teaching me...new things. Always believing in me, so...

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
me, so the family support there was...was phenomenal, um...

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
um and I know you can always count on them, no matter what.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So...what was it like to leave the neighborhood, I'm assuming you...you left...

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
well that..that...  I wasn't talking to you here but...[laughs]

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
That's interesting when...how I became....how I came to leave the neighborhood

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
is interesting

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
It's interesting. So I was um, so after growing up in Ozone

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Ozone Park Queens and that's where I really thought my world was, I didn't think it needed to be any bigger

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
than that. Um, and that's kind of the way we just grew up, and it was just

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
just all about our little world. And it wasn't until I became injured

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
injured, um, and had my spinal cord injury that I realized there's a much bigger world

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
bigger world...and that wasn't until...twenty

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Twenty two. Um, so it was...you know it was, ah....

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
It's very close knit and you just felt comfortable where you were and you never got out of your comfort zone and you weren't really

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
weren't really encouraged to get out of your comfort zone as much, and it was fine and that's the world we lived in

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
in and wasn't until I got hurt that I realized there were a lot bigger things in the world that were out there

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
there...um...

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So was that...that...that...that was interesting, um...

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Um, and ah, once ah, so I got...I was injured

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
injured in a bicycle accident in 1994, the year the New York Rangers won the Stanley 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Stanley Cup, because I'm a hockey fan, and...I was downhill mountain...

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
mountain bike riding in Queens, in Forest Park Queens, and ah,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
it was a rainy day, and my friends and I...were...riding um

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
in the park and we were trying to figure out...you know

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
what to do, and it was a kind of a slow day, and I was really wanted to

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
pick up the pace, and right before we started to pick up the pace a friend of ours got

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
it hurt and he went home [ringing in the background]

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And um....[movements] and he went home and I was about to go home

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
home with him and I didn't.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So. After that happened.... after he, he left

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
left, we...I wanted to pick up the pace, and I said let's go, let's pick up the pace so

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
we went to the top of one of the hills, and...my...everyone stopped, and I was like let's go

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
let's go...let's go... and we picked up the pace, and I've... decided to head down the hill

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
hill first. And when I did....from what my friends tell me, I flew over

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
my handlebars into a tree...and....

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
went head first into the tree and then fell down.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Um, and...the only thing I remember

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
remember is descending down the hill and that was it, I don't remember anything in between and then waking up

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And when I woke up I went to go move my fingers and, I was like OK.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And I went to go move my toes. And when I went to move my toes I knew I was paralyzed

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And from there it was, um, it was pretty tough. At that particular

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
particular moment. So [sighs]. Ambulance

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
ambulance came. Friends were supportive that were there

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
when I was biking with probably like ten... ten close friends.  Wow.  Yeah, it was a...a...

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
very close knit...neighborhood and we...we did a lot of things together

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and when I got hurt it was...You remember being carried out and then going to the hospital, Jamaica hospital

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Jamaica hospital in Queens, and then realizing...that my life is going to change

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
change...and...I remember it being in and out, and experience a lot of pain.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
So.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
My new life story.  And I was ah, I was born differently now. Um...

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I was born able bodied and now I was born disabled and

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
life changed...so, um, then a new world opened up for me which I never knew

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
knew what...what..what that would be or where I was going was a new path.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So talk about that a little bit more, that..that kind of, that new world that...that opened up to you.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Umm, how long were you in...how long were you in the hospital for...and...

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
what was kind the transition like going from there, back home, and then

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and to this new world [laughs]

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So [sighs]...to re...to rewind, uh, just a little bit

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Um, my high school was based in Queens and

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and... I come from a long line of blue collar workers

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And...come from

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
carpenters to mechanics to electricians, and

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
we

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.000
we

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
didn't really go to college, not many people in my family did, my brother was the first one

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
to go to college that I can remember, and

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
he went to N.Y.U. and our PAP was blue collar work, and we were OK with that

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
my dad made a really good,um, you know, good enough living...to support our family and give us what we

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
what we needed so I wanted to go to college.... I didn't want to go to college I wanted to be...

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
a blue collar worker, so I went to Thomas Edison in...in...Jamaica, Queens

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Queens, and I became...a plumber, because they had plumbing class and I had a lot of blue

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
collar work there.  Ah, lot of shops, and I didn't want to be a mechanic

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and I wanted to make more money and plumbing seemed to be...the way to do it your crap is my bread

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and butter. [laughter in the background] Ah, so...

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
I was...I was a successful plumber.  Uh...I was about two years away from getting my plumber's

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
plumber's license, um I was doing well and so my life was...was...was pretty

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
good. I had everything and everything I needed, and my path was going well

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
into my career, and then when I got hurt, everything kind of

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
shifted...um. So, after I got hurt I was in the hospital and

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and I was stabilized in the hospital, um my brother, Louis, did a lot of

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
work to get me in all the right places to make sure I had all the right health care

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
care that I needed and went to all the right hospitals. And I went to Mt. Sinai

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Hospital. For rehabilitation.  And that...

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
that's when things just started to open up for me, so I got

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
hurt on July twenty.... sssss....

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I want to say twenty fourth, twenty sixth, of 1994.  

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and I think in August some time we went over to Mount Sinai Hospital for rehabilitation.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.000
.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And when I was there it was quite interesting because there were a lot of younger...

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
people with spinal cord injuries, because that's what happened...um...I injured my spinal cord, not sure if I said that earlier.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
earlier. Um, and when I injured my spinal cord

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
..and...just....going to rehab, and I met other young people with spinal cord

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
spinal cord injury so it was really like this network of people that we were there together and we were all

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
all experienced the same thing, which was pretty helpful because it um...

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
it made me understand that I wasn't alone, and at...at the hospital...

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I met an amazing physical therapist, Laura...Laura Crandell, and she was..

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
she was just amazing give me everything that I needed was real supportive in

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
so many different ways. She was not only physical therapist she became a really good

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
friend to this day and she's been here really. She has

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
been very helpful in who I am. So I got hurt went through

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
rehab found out lots of different things about myself my body

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
changed you know now I went from an able bodied person to a person now using wheelchair and

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
basically only using half my body because I'm paralyzed from the bottom of my chest.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
So everything was different I had to learn how to. Get out

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
of bed to head it we're going to get dressed I had to learn to take care of my power plant

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
bowel and bladder because everything changes. How to push a wheelchair how to

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
transfer in a wheelchair. So all those things kind of you know as a twenty two year old

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
male you don't expect that to happen. Able bodied male so and then my

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
life was changed so I had to learn that through rehab and that's where everything was because

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I had other friends too to learn from and go through with and Laura was

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
big in my physical therapy. And I

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
want to be active and I read I was talking to the lore

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
about that and saying what can we do. She's like well there's Wilcher basketball and everybody knows about

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
wheelchair basketball and I hated basketball and growing up that's

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
one of the sports that I just wasn't good at and we were playing roller hockey and my friends

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and I at that particular time when I got hurt and I can never play hockey again.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
So I was handed a magazine called Sports and spokes and that's

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
disabled athletes Sports Illustrated and it talks about all the types of different

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
sports that are. That are out there and I thought I

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
read about a sport called slut and reading about it was one thing but there weren't any pictures and I

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
was trying to figure out what it was about and I spoke to another

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
person in the disability world that was selling Will church at the time Dilly Lear

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and I asked him about the sport cults that hockey is like oh I have a friend who plays who

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
plays it out on Long Island has it all great so he gave me his number it was Tony Fitzgerald

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and Tony and I connected and in a slight Archy is a sport

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
where you sit on a sled on the ice with two i split underneath you and your

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
legs are out in front of you and you have two miniature hockey sticks

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
about two feet long ice pick on one and a hockey stick on your other.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And what you do is you have two sticks and you propel yourself across the ice in

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
a in a cross-country movement cross-country skiing movement and

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
that and you propel yourself across the ice and I thought it was great. And when I

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
went out and I tried it and it was a lot of fun and I thought it was

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
just for me just something to do. I didn't realize how competitive they can actually be

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
. So I went out all the time we played it and all of a sudden one

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
day we went to. This rink into national players came

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
out. It was Kip St Germain from Boston

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
. Massachusetts. Area not actually from Cape Cod

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Dave Conklin from Wisconsin and they were both on the national team and they came out and he skied it and when I

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
saw them skate they were just skating rings around us making all these turns

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and doing all these things. Parkin lifting the puck in really playing hockey.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Wow wise how do we do that. So my friend Tony and I got in touch with

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
them and skated with them and eventually we were invited out to a national tour

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and the national team tryouts or practices in Wisconsin. So here

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
here I am going you know generally two things New Yorkers do when they go on vacation when they travel they go

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:22.000
to real New Yorkers they go to Vegas or Florida but now

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
here I am going to Wisconsin

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
. So it was it was it was a culture shock you play hockey

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
right.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And it was kind of a culture shock to me and then things are just different. And

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
like I said I didn't get out of my neighborhood all that much when I was a kid and here I am in

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Wisconsin and all the sudden we're playing in not only in this one in Wisconsin I'm meeting people from

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
from around the country Minnesota Wisconsin you know Boston

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
area and my world started to open up a little bit and start to travel

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
a little bit more detained. Then I'm in different parts of the country

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and I got invited made in one thousand nine hundred sixteen

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
World Cup champion team that went to Sweden so let the

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
a Swede. So now I'm in Sweden and I'm starting to travel the

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
world and seeing a lot bigger thing and my world is really starting to

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
open up and the sport really helped

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
me deal with my disability. Meet other people with disabilities understand

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
what it's like to be an athlete with a disability and ninety

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
seven we got invited out to another World Cup team. We went to

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Sweden and then in one thousand nine hundred eighty

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
I met I made the national team national Paralympic

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
team the first USA Paralympic slappy team and we were going to not going to

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Japan and but in between that we were hosting clinics and traveling all around the country

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
and world for that matter. We were hosting clinics sled hockey clinics in.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Colorado and we were hosting slutty clinics in Dallas and then we were hosting site of

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
clinics in Philadelphia and we were just. Trying to grow the sport as we were

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
moving forward going to the Paralympics because we really wanted to get a lot more people

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
involved in in one thousand nine hundred eighty with the Paralympic Games in not going to Japan

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
. And it was one of the most amazing spirit experiences I've

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
ever had to be able to represent our country at a high level growing up.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
We've always seen the Olympics and we always want to be part of that and dreamed about it and I

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
always wanted to be a baseball player and do some great things but I never got there.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
But being disabled these opportunities were there and I was able to take advantage

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
of those opportunities and a lot of people with disabilities have opportunities now that they

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
never had that they were able bodied those were people that were injured after after

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
later on in life and it was just a world that was

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
like wow and travel the world and I never would have done that if it wasn't

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
for my spinal cord. And sport we did like

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
amazing things for me and I to this day I am committed to support

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
and helping young kids with disabilities. So

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
that's kind of my story about how I got from being

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
in Ozone Park Queens to really traveling the world and

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
and being part of something that no one can ever take away from

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
You know some of them credible people on the waves here.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
I've met so many incredible people I met so many different cultures

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
and understand those cultures and being able to

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
. Just be part of it. She says

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
shape who I am today and without sport that never would have happened

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:03.000
.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Sport is powerful.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And you're in a pretty incredible position here too.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
So do you want to talk a little bit about that. You kind of became

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
interested in politics for sure.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
So as I was participating in the Paralympic Games I knew I had

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
to do. I knew I had to do something with my life.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
And plumbing was not an option anymore. I could climb the ladder. I

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
couldn't shut off valve couldn't get down the basement.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
So I had to do something different. And the thing that motivated me

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
. Was sport.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
So I went back to school. I never thought I'd go to college and I

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
pursued a degree in sports and ministration at St John's University.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
And through that I learned lots of different things about

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
sports in the business of sport. And Sports Marketing and so on and so forth. And I got

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
involved with a nonprofit organization that was doing

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
that was involved in adaptive sport adaptive sport disabled sport it's all

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
kind of the same so you may hear me say that so it's all interchangeable. And

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
I got involved with an organization called Eastern Paralyzed Veterans Association

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
and they serve veterans with disabilities and I worked in there.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
In their sports department as a recreation aide what I would do basically I would go to

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
veterans affairs hospitals within within the New York area in Pennsylvania

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
. And

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
. So it used to be so I was working with Eastern Paralyzed Veterans

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Association and I was working at V.A. hospitals here in the New York City area in

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Pennsylvania and I was just

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
getting my feet wet trying to understand the disabled sports world and I was a

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
recreation aide and I was basically going to be a hospitals and playing

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
cards or. Or checkers with some of the guys at

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
bedside. People spinal cord injuries. At

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
some of the hospitals and eventually that grew into a lot of different other opportunities

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
and eventually putting on the disabled sports clinics and it can range anything

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
from hand cycling. To.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Track and field events to archery to air guns to

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
look for basketball program center and eventually I grew in that recreation aide

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
and with my education I went through the ranks of the P.V.A. Eastern

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
paralyzed their association and I did lots of different things in the

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
recreation department and started running clinics in Buffalo and Philadelphia in

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
lots of different areas of adaptive sport and that kind of gave me the basis of where I

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
wanted to do and then eventually started doing more and more things nationally and

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
and with the Paralympics having the Paralympic experience behind me being disabled athlete. I

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
started to get more involved in lots of different areas of sport

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
and I started to get involved. In

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
tok finding a way to tie able bodied sports and disabled sports together.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
So I started to work with professional franchises here

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
in New York City like The New York Mets The New York Yankees the New York Islanders in the New York Rangers

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
and I really wanted to marry them I was organizations with disabled sport because it

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
would bring the exposure for the disabled athlete to show that they were under the big sports umbrella

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
and of these professional franchises and

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
also being able to show that person professional franchises care about people with

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
disabilities and you know it's a good synergy between Beau and eventually I was able to

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
secure sponsorships with all the major teams here in New York. So every

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
If you look at every disabled every sports team in New York City today they

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
sponsor a disabled sports team so I got involved with the National Hockey League in Major League

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Baseball to kind of promote this and it was a model that I started

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
to use and eventually I rose to the ranks of the P.G.A. which later

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
changed your name to United sponsor solution. And I eventually became the

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
director sportsman working.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
There and so I did a lot of stuff in between

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
. In between.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
A recreation aide to sports marking another position that it held

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
at the newly named United Spano Association was director of special projects and

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
what I started to do there as director of special projects is

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
. Understand the government world of what they were doing so I would be going

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
to Capitol Hill and Bobby for

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
specific issues that they were looking to get

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
pushed in federal government you know things like transportation.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
There was some stem cell research that we were they were pushing for.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
We were pushing for health care initiatives

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
. So there was a lot of different things that I was doing and I was

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
took some of that those initiatives to Albany and

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
started lobbying in that and so that was just getting my feet wet in that type of.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Area and I never pictured myself being involved in government any way shape or

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
form remember I'm a plumber from Queens so you know

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
this is really interesting to me and what was happening in New York City about that

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
time when I was getting involved in all this government relations stuff was that New York

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
City was bidding for. The two thousand and twelve Olympic Paralympic Games

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
and they started to reach out to New Yorkers. Who were

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
part of the Olympic and Paralympic teams and they reached out to me and I started to get

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
involved in my experience with government and

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
accessibility and now sports all

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
tied perfectly into this Olympic Paralympic bid that we're going through so I was part of

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
that. The N.Y.C. twenty twelve Olympic Paralympic bid and was

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
involved on lots of levels where I dressed United States Olympic

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Committee on why they should bring the games here the International Olympic and Paralympic committee of

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
why they should bring the games here to New York so I started doing a lot of that and they got me involved.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Worked on the accessibility of the villages that they were there were the people's villages that were there

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
and start to get involved and I was fortunate at that time

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
to run into that then parks commissioner Adrian Bennett Pete. And I

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
simply. I sat next to him at an event that we were

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
going to address the International Olympic Committee and they

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
were briefing us on something and I roll and I sit next to a person and I say

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Hello Victor Cleese he goes Hello I major in bed a P and I was pleased to meet you

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
and then I realized who he was he was the Parks Commission. Very pleased to meet you. So

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Adrian I got to talking and I said I really want to help make

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
parks accessible. For people disabilities because I've travelled

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
around the country and around the world in New York City to do better job because you know we are absolutely great

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
. So we started working with them on lots of different projects when I was with United on

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
association and Major and I struck up a pretty good relationship

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
and I started to do more work with the Parks Department

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
and one day I was going to talk to him and say you know I'm interested in the job but

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
he said there's a job available and you should apply and I was applied for the job

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
and it was called. It was an A.B.A.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
coordinator and accessibility coordinator for the parks department and I

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
applied for the job and I was lucky enough to get it.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
So now I'm working for city government and it was really interesting what was

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
happening at the time with the Parks Department is they were audited by New York state saying

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
they were deficient in seven areas of accessibility for people of

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
disabilities in the park system and they needed to. The

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
seven areas needed they needed to create a dollar threshold amount to

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
make ensure that accessibility. You know the money's being pushed towards accessibility they need to

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
. Have a grievance procedure on their website

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
they need to provide signage is the signage through the Porta throughout the park system

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
they needed to. It's higher

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
in eighty coordinator and they needed to come up with

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
an eighty wide transition plan and how they're going to go from

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
non accessibility excess ability. That's only five and I forget what the other

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
two are at this point which is just to be clear on that.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
And my job now is task to to look at

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
the twenty nine thousand acres of parks that the city has and in those twenty one thousand

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
acres of parks or five hundred sixty five large parks and small parks thirty five recreation centers

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
fourteen miles of beaches twelve

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
historic houses. I pick them off with that number six hundred fifty

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
fifty six bathrooms and I have to know about and talk with people to do is need to get to an accessible

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
bathroom so the system is pretty big where the principal writer of sports

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
facilities in New York City. Recreation facilities. So I had a look at this whole system

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
and create a plan to make it accessible. So.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
I started to get involved and figure out how we do this in the parks department had some model set up

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
that were there before but we look at those models and redefine them and we train

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
managers within the park system on what he codes and standards why are

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
we keep riding them with checklists to go out come back with these checklist and I had to

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
analyze all that data and put it into a document. The parks department tried doing this years and

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
years back. But never were able to come up with the full plan.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
So I was able to within I think two years or so we were able to come up with a plan and address the

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
accessibility issues. From a physical standpoint point then we needed to really

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
look at their programs and services because

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000
title and title to the A.B.A. says any programs or services that you

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000
provide for people. Without disability should be providing

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.000
for people with disabilities so I had a look at the programs and services to make sure the

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
programs and services are complying with the Americans With Disabilities Act we had to look at their

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
capital projects and make sure that everything in their capital projects including excess abilities was a

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
lot of training that need to be done on their part and I have to

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
say through that work. New York City has to be if not the

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
most successful processing system in the world. I've been to other parts of it.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
I've been to other parks and when I've been traveling around the country and around the world and

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Chicago does a great job on accessibility in parks but the. Parks Department has it

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
right when they are looking at their designs there. They're talking about

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
making sure that everybody's included people with kids with autism where there's quiet spaces for a

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
man and looking at people with visual

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
disabilities and making sure this color contrast and people. Of all

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
abilities that are all encompassed now and in their design in making sure that kids can move through the

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
space regardless of their disability or not. So and now we

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
need a court there's a media coordinator still in place and they're continuing to.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
I pushed that mission on him and then I through my

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.000
work with the parks department I was in touch with the mayor's office for people with disabilities on lots of different

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
issues because it just seemed like the proper synergy that needed to happen.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
So I was involved with the commissioner then Matthew sapling was wonderful

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Gary. Everyone loved and it's a great thing for this city for accessibility as a

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
whole and I think

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
it was a bunch of years into Matt's position here he

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
ended up passing away unfortunately. And the position opened and

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
I was fortunate enough to be able to have some people that pushed my name forward

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
. I interviewed for the job and

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
lo and behold I'm here and now I am the commissioner of the mayor's office for people with disabilities and

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
being able to drive the agenda for people with

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
disabilities is pretty.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Oh yeah you can see what I'm saying. The last position

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
so what.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
So tell me a little bit about the changes that you hope to

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
see and accessibility of next years.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Well there's a lot and I mean our goal here is to make New York City more success and city in the

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
world and there are some cities that are newer than ours that have a big jump on us and it's

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
one of the you know great city that's accessible in Washington D.C. is accessible

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
but their subways are a little bit you know or they can have a great transportation system

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000
. But New York City has some amazing things that make our city accessible. We were

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
the leader in buses back in in the eighty's we were building accessible parks

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
back then too. And everything that we do people around the

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000
world.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Listen to so you know that's that's that's that's really

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
bad again. Now Mayor de Blasio has just really

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
championed signing and agreeing to making fifty percent of the cabs accessible by

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
twenty twenty which is going to set the standards I believe

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
through all of US cities for accessibility in cabs so that transportation model

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
in itself is is big and you know I expect that to grow and will

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
probably be even bigger than fifty percent but the market will dictate that.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.000
And is just changing the perception of disability.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Here in New York City and no one wants to be seen now

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
. But over time you will either become

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.000
disabled be temporarily disabled or know someone that's disabled

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
it will affect you. It's just a matter of the way you're not going to escape this world

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
And you will address at some point your life so I'm trying to say let's be

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
proactive and let's think about including this stuff now. There's been a lot of work that our office has

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:38.000
been doing. My first deputy commissioner Robert

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Piccolo's wrote a book called inclusive design guidelines that look at the Americans With Disabilities Act

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
guidelines and go over and beyond what accessibility is and really make an inclusive environment

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
so we're really pushing that in working with our city our city agencies to

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
really push that in part is doing a great job working with the Buildings Department designed contraption

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
the partner transportation to really make that part of the culture. So when they look at

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
accessibility it's just there we don't have to fight and argue that it's already budgeted for it's

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
already in there to be able to look at that. I want to be able to have.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Would serve the parks department really well as having that eighty eight coordinator there to be able to

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
guide the parks department as part of what they do now. And now other agencies

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
to be able to do that now the partner of Transportation has hired a

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
eighty coordinator pollers eighty analysts that's there is talking about accessibility issues that now it's

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
there it's all part of their process human resource administration is doing that

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
on the on the human resources side to be able to show that these things need to be

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
here too and there's other agencies that are starting to do this as well so we will have that point of

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
contact is extraordinary and just part of what we do. It's

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
not different it's just all inclusive so being able to build that model

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
is going to make New York City the most successful city in the world I have no doubt about that.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000
What do you know

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
. Yes yes I am very fortunate I have

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
a beautiful wife Susan and two and two beautiful daughters

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Sophia and Lola you tell me about meeting in your life

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
my life. Yes yes meeting my wife we

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
were married for fifteen years now. As any marriage has its ups and

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
downs but I'm very fortunate to have such a great

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
partner.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
That has helped guide me in so many different ways

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
To be so my wife Susan is how did we meet. Let's see

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
after two years after my injury. I met

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
my wife Susan. I was rehabbing at a facility called

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Asphalt Green I was riding a bike.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
It's called an F.P.S. bike functional electrical stimulation so

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
it would stimulate my legs and I would ride a stationary bike electrical

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
stimulate electrical stimulation to my legs and I would ride the stationary bike which would

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
help build up the muscle tone of my legs and help with cardiovascular

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
cardiovascular. So I was doing that and Susan

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
just happened to work there she was not my therapist you know to make that clear. She just happened to work there

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000
and you know she came walking in and I remember hearing her boots and turning around saying

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
that so you know I started to get friendly with her

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
and I tried asking around. Turned down a couple times but I was a

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
little persistent and eventually she said yes and

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
we were at a wine tasting one night just as friends and it was

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
going to sing for years. The spinal cord research and

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
we were having a good time and my friend was happened to be bothering her and said you know your friend's a

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
jerk and I was like OK OK I know that you want to sit on my lap and

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
that was it. And we've been together since probably gathered for seventeen years now.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Yes She's she's she's a physical therapist and I figured I'd marry

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
a physical therapist why because they're cute they're active they make good money and

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
if I get hurt they can take care of me. So every time something happens just cause you some such

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
. Thing. The physical therapy Portas

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
the pullover that much as I expected to get to have two kids yes

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
. Sophia who's in seventh grade now

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
and Lola who is. In fourth grade.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
So question I want to ask

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
your kids. Months and years from now or even next year.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
What's what you want what you want done about lessons that

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
you learn from your from your own mouth.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Well I mean I think we try to show our kids how important it is to give

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
back and how important is to be involved. As I

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
mentioned how important it is. How much sport is

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
given me. I also realize that there needs to be someone that needs to be able

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
to drive that sport and I'm committed to working with an

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
organization called the Winter Sports Federation that helps people disabilities be

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
involved in sport and I'm also involved in making sure that kids with

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
disabilities have this opportunity for sport because generally a kid with a disability.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
It goes to school and goes home. There are hardly ever involved

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
in other types of activities unless they find it in some way shape or form. So

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
being able to have a kid with a disability show up at school and say

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
yeah I scored a goal or I scored a basket or I travelled here like

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
every other their able bodied peers do is important to me. So sled hockey has

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
given me so much and I want to get back to that and we started a kid's team

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
and we have about thirty kids with disabilities all throughout the New York City area

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
. And we have kids from whom we have we have kids from affluent

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
families to kids who are inner city families and being

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
able to guide those kids and show them how important sport is at a very young

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
age to build. Their self-esteem and show them what they can do

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
and show them that they can easily be part of anything that they want to they can

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:55.000
be the commissioner of the mayor's office for people with disabilities. They can be the core

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Council of the city of New York. They can be anything they want and being able to give him the

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
basis and show them that that exists is important and I

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
believe sport helps build that self-esteem so. I want to be able to give back

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
and that's important so I want to I want my kids to understand how important is to give back to

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
always be able to do that because I've been fortunate in life to get some great

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
things and I think it's important for them to understand that too. So

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
I think they got a good basis of that now that I can

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
I want them to continue to make a difference in people's lives and I think that's important

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
that's the reason why I'm involved in this and just knowing where I've gone and how fortunate

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000
I've been through my career to meet the people along the way that I've been able to

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
give me what I need to move forward.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Is important and I think everybody needs someone to be able to do that.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
And when the questions it's kind of a big question. Thinking back to

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
yourself. Age twenty two years. Final cord injury what

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
is yourself now when you tell somebody age twenty two

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
. You tried your terrorists that

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
happen and you were in the hospital and during that time what is yourself

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000
. You know one thing that's really not that bad. It's great like

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
You don't see that when you first get hurt and I've

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
been you know they're there it's tough. It's always going to be tough and life is

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
tough you know it's just another obstacle in having an obstacle to overcome just make sure that much

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
stronger and having a disability that's probably

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
one of the best things in my life.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Best Thing That Ever Happened to me.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
I'm.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Not sure I mean so much so my family and how supportive

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000
. My family is very supportive

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
One thing I did fail to mention is how important my sister was in everything

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
that was there to you and me and my my parents were there. My

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
brother was there but my sister was also

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
constantly there is always there for me. I think that's important and

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
in my extended family is important to him that we're able

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
that have been supportive in lots of different ways. But in the end my

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
sister was definitely always trying to make it better for me.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Especially when you're in the hospital. She would we would ask for strange things and she'd

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
always come through with it we'd ask you to make it better so we can eat it takes practice. But

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
my sister was really it was really fun and exciting.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Yeah I had I don't I'm probably sure I missed a lot.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
And if you think you think of something I can always come back here and record more. So

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
that's also something.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Yeah I mean we just wonder if I if I got enough.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Working with the disabled community. Enough about that.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
What are what are some stories that stand

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
out from your time here.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
There.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Was a lot Hurricane Sandy was it was tough working through Hurricane Sandy and

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
trying to get people disability and find out where everyone was and what

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
everyone needed and we we had a lot of success stories about being able to help people

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000
get wheelchairs after a worry or get medical equipment or get people back away

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
from their apartments so we and we were doing an extraordinary amount of work during

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000
that period to be able to help people disabilities and we're continuing. We

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
continue to help people with disabilities I mean there's some stories in being

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
able to connect people with all the right resources. We were fortunate here I

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
know at one point during especially during Sandy one of my co-workers.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
We're able to save a person's life because they were on the phone

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
with them and found out that we were able to get some food there

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
and someone knocked on the door and no one answered and they opened the door and sure enough

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
the person was lying on the floor and they were able to call my mom one but if we weren't able to connect him to the food

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
resources. So if we were doing a lot around there and in a lot of

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000
different ways you can try to connect to the stable community and have them have access to our office so they can

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
access the city resources something that we're committed to doing as well and we

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
continue to do that and we we want people to be connected to city services

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
because it's what we're supposed to be doing.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
But there are lots of stories in getting kids connected and

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
gavel the sweet spot for kids. Tell me a kid with a disability and you

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
know figure out a way to help themselves and we're planning some great things for the twenty fifth anniversary of the

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:08.000
A.D.F..

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
I'm really looking forward to my July

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
when you plan on releasing all its

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
website upgrade times.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000

Freeze them so much it sound you know right now. OK.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Actually the Times has an article.

A little bit today. I saw that yeah I saw that about the parade. Yes yes. So

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
we're working on some stuff. Yeah yeah it's great to read.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Yeah it's amazing to me means smart because the

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
question is how many things you learned over the years how do you like I

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
mean you know your time initially starting at you know experience.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Yes you do you know to you know sports administration to

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.000
sport in general and I also went back to get my Masters two in

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000
activity in Urban Urban Affairs to kind of understand our

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
government.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
So yeah and this is a guy that didn't want to go to college and you know we

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000
call it work road and I never thought I'd

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
succeed the way I was.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
It's really it's been a great ride. It really has been very very very very

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
fortunate to to come into what I've got and I've got a lot of good

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
people on my side you know.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
And so I went I went for him each summer

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
some of I think some of the great things that happen to me is when I got hurt

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
I kind of lost everything. I didn't lose my family support by a lost

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
. My job I lost my medical benefits

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
and have any way of making any money so I was on Medicaid and Medicare

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
couldn't get what I wanted. You know at the drop of

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
a hat and you know I had my family but I was and I used them only when I needed

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:21.000
but I you know I was you know I was I lost everything.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000
And I'm thankful for that because I understand what it's like

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
now. And I you know I could put myself in that person's shoes and say you know I know what it's like to be on

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Medicare and know what it's like to receive Social Security benefits and not have enough to feed yourself

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
you know and make make decisions that you know I don't necessarily want to me make

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:46.000
you know I was fortunate to be able to go to my mother's house to be eat right so that was always an option

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
but there are people that don't have that option and you know that's real

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
and you know by losing everything it made me understand you know like I

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
get it and I and without social programs.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000
I don't know I don't know how would you know that Medicare without Medicaid without

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:12.000
being able to have the funding to be able to get financial aid

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000
to go back to school without programs like Access V.R. which gave me

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000
the resources to go back to school gave me.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
They put hand controls in my car this is a state run agency that tried to get people

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000
disability back into employment. They put hand controls in my car. They give me money to get

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
gas to put gas in my car. They paid for some tuition and they paid for my

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
books and there was just the social programs out there and if people

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
take advantage of these programs. Where they can they can definitely change your

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
lives. You know and I'm grateful for that and I know

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
firsthand and I can relate to people you could say well what do you know you have this is like no I

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
do know but it's hard to convey that message when you're this high people think you

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
know everything was handed to you and wasn't. But that's what's so cool.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Yeah it is really well with us.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
Great hearing your story and you know thank you appreciate that

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.000
they appreciate that.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Yeah it's it's fun. Yeah. Fantine will change people's lives. It's

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
just for the for the better. It's what makes you get up every

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000
morning. Makes you want to do better. You remember what his life was a phone

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000
and phone.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Do you have anything else that you want to say it's recording

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
now.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Well yes I want to thank you. Well thank you and I want everybody to participate in the

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
oral history right.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000
We'll talk about how we can make that happen

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000
. Yeah and I mean anything we need to put up on our website.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Anything we need to do just let us know we're behind it.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000
If you find. Some way that you tell us you want

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000
to promote it just let us know. I think this is great I think it's important that people

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.000
disability lives are hurt and I

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
want everyone to do it I think it's important.
