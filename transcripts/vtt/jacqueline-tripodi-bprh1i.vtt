00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So my name is Alex Kelly and I'm sitting here with Jackie Tripodi we're at

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Lifestyles on Staten Island and this is for the oral history project Visible

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Lives oral histories of the disability experience for the New York Public Library.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It is April 2, 2015 and Jackie I just want to 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
start out if you could tell me a little bit about what brings you here today.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well I actually work for Lifestyles for the Disabled and I had a meeting in the building

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
um

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Diane Campion who is one of the public library employees said to me you know we're doing

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
something exciting to educate people about people with disabilities if I would be interested

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and I'm always interested to share my Joseph story so I said absolutely. Great.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Right, so can you tell me about when Joseph was born and the month

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
months leading up to that.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Well I could actually this month in eighteen days my Joseph will be

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
twenty two years old.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
He has a twin sister Danielle. Danielle and Joseph were born fifteen weeks

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
prematurely. They were one pound seven ounces, one pound nine ounces at birth.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
They spent one hundred twenty days in the neonatal intensive care unit.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Danielle was born screaming. As she's a little girl and now she's a

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
young woman who's still screaming and my son, Joseph, was breech.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Not breathing and needed to be resuscitated a few times. They both

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
had an intervention or healer hemorrhages brain bleeds when they were born. And.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Danielle's was a grade two which could have had her have severe disabilities. Joseph was

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
a grade four and he wasn't expected to survive. So when they

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
were born we were in shock. Needless to say because they weren't due until August second.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And they were born in which month again? April. April. In eighteen days this month they'll be twenty two

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
years old. So you know leading up to my pregnancy was short

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because I was only twenty five weeks pregnant when I gave birth. So we didn't have time to

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
plan and you know we didn't have the nursery ready. We didn't have any of that.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So when they were born so soon there, you know, it was a

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
life changing, needless to say, event. As they said they were spent one hundred twenty

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
days in the intensive care unit. During that time they had

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
ups and downs in their development and survival. We did have funeral arrangements

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
for them by the time July came uh because they weren't gaining

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
weight and they were just really very very sick for a very long time.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
As we would have it, we're fortunate. August seventeenth we were able to take them

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
home from the hospital.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
A whopping four pounds, seven ounces and four pounds

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
four ounces. Which was actually, you know, they kind of they let

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
us. we weren't really supposed to, you know, under five pounds you're not supposed to really take them home.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
They spent four months in the hospital and we had, my husband I, had to take first aid

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
C.P.R. classes just so that we could take them home. They had

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
episodes of apnea. Um, they couldn't breathe and you know

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
they had to be reminded, come on, breathe, Danielle breathe. You knowthere were a lot of

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
situations in the hospital that you had us on our edge

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Um, Joseph did have more of the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
complications than Danielle. He had his grade four intervention

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
hemorrhage caused him develop hydrocephalus. um, where he

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Fluid started to you know gather in the brain. He needed to have a Fontanella.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
His fontanella drained. His lung collapsed. um. He had a failure to

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
thrive and was just really really very sick for a very long time.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
He had one episode in July prior to us

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
making that sad arrangement was that his retinas detached and I got a phone call

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
at 8 in the morning. " Mrs. Tripodi, if Joseph doesn't have surgery today he's going to be totally

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
blind as it is, you know, he's going to, we'll be lucky if we save any of his vision." But I had 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
to go to one hospital, sign him out,  because a doctor didn't have rights. He

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
was two pounds at the time. They had to transfer him from one hospital to the next. I went to

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
the next hospital. He was in St Vincent's. We had to

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
go to Staten Island Hospital. I had to leave my daughter Danielle who had had a difficult night.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
She was, she had a distended stomach and she she just she was fussing and they said you

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
know she just wasn't looking good. And I had to take my son but she had to

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
trim it, travel in an ambulance because he was still on oxygen in an incubator to another

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
hospital. So he can get the surgery to save his sight. Now at the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
time, back in nineteen-ninety-three, we didn't have cell phones.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
My husband was at work. And I was by myself. And

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
He came home to a note on the door. That said Had to go to hospital

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Julie may be blind. Wow. Yeah. It was.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
We had our, our marriage definitely suffered 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
without a doubt. But, in any event, the ambulance took

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Joseph from St Vincent to Staten Island Hospital. I took the car. I

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
met them because I had to go sign him in. And I get to Staten Island Hospital and nobody

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
knows when my two pound baby is. For half an hour.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Nobody could tell me where my son was. I Hhad just left my

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
daughter, in distress. No idea where my son is. I'm by

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
myself. And I am

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Not kind in my 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Sailor-like language.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
How's that for being politically correct?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And. When they finally found Joseph I somehow beat the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
ambulance to the hospital and I don't know how that was possible but I did. I don't know why I took the

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
ambulance that long to get there but, in any event, when I saw my son the doctor said

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Well.  Has the mother been told not to interfere and I'm thinking he didn't realize that I was the mom. Cause I

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
look young. When I was twenty-seven I looked even younger

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and, you know, I was treated as though I was, you know, a teenager who gave birth

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
to, you know, a child. I didn't know what I was doing. So, the doctors was,you know

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
has the mother been told not to interfere? and I said "I'm his mother what do you mean told not to interfere and he said

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
well, should he start to deteriorate when we take him off the oxygen, because, we need to take more of the oxygen to

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
perform the operation. You have to, you know, he, if

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
he has if he's going to. He's pretty much is going to die and I told

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
him in a very unladylike way, I won't repeat it now because I don't think you want

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
profanity in this. That if anything happened to my son he would be dead

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
too. And, the nurse that accompanied my son, who's always seen me as

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
the mom who's always crying, you know.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Obviously I was I was crying. You know my two children were very sick.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
She had never seen me get so angry and was like OK

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Mrs. Tripodi calm down, he's going to be OK and I said to the doctor said it took St

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Vincent's three months to convince me he may live. And now you're going to tell me my son's going to die

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
. And she she said It's OK Mrs. Tripodi so

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
P.S. My son had, you know, we're there, we're waiting for the doctor. It was Fourth of July weekend the

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
hospital was empty. The doctor had to come in from Manhattan to perform the surgery so we're

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
waiting. I'm by myself and then my husband finally came because he, you know, he didn't

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
know where to go. Because we didn't have phones. He went to St

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Vincents. He didn't go to Staten Island Hospital. So he was frantic in not knowing

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
what was going on with with his son. So he finally got there and then you know

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Joseph had the surgery and one of the things that happened was

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
he was crying. And I had to hear my son cry throughout the entire surgery.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
It's heartbreaking.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I don't need to tell you he was all of three months old two pounds

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Crying. And all that I could think of was

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
OK. If he's crying he's breathing if he's crying he's breathing. If he's crying he's breathing. 

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And as much as you didn't want him to have the distress, he was breathing

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So then after the operation,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I became very insistent and this was the start of the empowerment.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that you have to assume when you're a parent of a child with a special need

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And I insisted that the next day my son be transferred

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
back to St Vincent's Hospital. They said "Well Mrs.Tripodi you know he's here already." I

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
said I want my children in the same hospital. I want them together. They're

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
twins. I do not want this. I do not want the care of this hospital

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
because of the way that we were treated when he first came. It'ss not what I want.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And, my son was then transferred the next day back to St Vincent's Hospital.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Finally they came home in August seventeenth and as I said Joseph had quite a few

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
You know trials and tribulations and we immediately started

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
evaluations because knowing that I had two children with intraventricular

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
bleeds. My sister-in-law is an occupational therapist and I was blessed that she would

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
say to me, "Jackie they need to be evaluated. It wasn't enough that they survived.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Now you need to see that they get the support they need so that they can develop."

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So she said, you know, do that and I set up the evaluations right after. You know

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
they got discharged August seventeenth. The first week of September we had the first

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
evaluations. They started services by the third week of September.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And we had an on-slew of occupational therapy, physical

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
therapy. Special education services. Speech therapy.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
The counselor come in so that to help me understand things and we had a

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
nutritionist come so that I can know what to do as far as you know if they

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
needed, you know, they had formula this that and because I couldn't breast feed while they were in the I.C.U. 

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
. I. Was barely five months pregnant and you know I

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000
just couldn't produce the milk to breastfeed and while they were in the hospital it just it was it was

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
too overwhelming to even think about doing that  so. So they were on formula and they did

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
all that and. Did I mention that my husband and I weren't even married six months

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
when I had my children. No. We got married in September

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I got married I got pregnant in November. And my children were born in

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
April. Wow. So we're married less than a year.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And, you know, so our first year of marriage was, you know,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
But by the time the kids came home, it was our first wedding anniversary and

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
It was just, um, an amazing roller coaster of,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
You know, how are we even going to do this.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
How did you meet your husband? Oh, my husband and I were on a blind date you know you know he's

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
really cute.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And you know we we met on a blind date in July and kind of moved in

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
together by September and then you know we were together two years and then you're married

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Two years after we got engaged so we were together for years before we get married and

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
You know, we we just we knew what we wanted. We were older. He was going to be thirty. I was

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
going to.. I was twenty seven so we weren't babies. And... But we didn't

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
expect to have you know when we had our kids that it was going to be all of

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that because we live in a glass house.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
I don't know if any other family member has shared this, but when you have a child with special needs

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
or any kind of medical issues and you have people in and out of your house, you live in

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
a glass house.  You can't fight with your husband in front of everybody. You

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
have schedules of people coming and going. You you can't sit down to a regular

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
family dinner, you know. If you leave a piece of paper on the table, you

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
know, your private information and you trust people because they're in your home and they're

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
you know they're taking care of your children they're helping you with your children. But there's no privacy

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And. My husband and I since our

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
wedding. Our marriage. And with our children being born so soon

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
have lived in a glass house and here we are I will I will be married twenty three years

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
in September my children be twenty two and in two weeks. And I still live

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000
in that glass house because I still have service providers.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
in and out of the house. Everybody and their mother has the key to my house because

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
people constantly coming and going. So. That was the first year

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
of marriage and the first six months of Dani Joey now right after Joey

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And Danny were discharged from the hospital within a week Joseph was re

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
hospitalized because he had a double hernia. Then he needed another surgery

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Long story short by the time Joseph was eighteen he

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
he's had seventeen surgeries. Wow. and he's always

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Smiled. He's he's got a fabulous personality.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
He. The

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
 best way I could describe my son's is is um he's motivational. He

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
motivates everybody to teach is to better not just for him. But

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
by him. His twin sister has been his driving force because

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
she has made progress and it's been bittersweet. Because I always say I'm the best I have the best of both

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
worlds. I have enabled and disabled because Danielle has had met her milestones

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and the hard part was that. As Danielle was making her monsoon starting to

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
stand and starting to walk. My son wasn't.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
When my son was. Twenty months he needed brain surgery for the hydrocephalus instead of a

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
shunt. We opted for brain surgery which was experimental at the time to

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
alleviate the fluid without giving him a lifelong implant.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
He did things because he saw his sister do things. So I've always strived to put

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Joseph in an environment where he may not be the highest functioning

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
individual.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
But he is somebody he's going to strike. And he you know there's that

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
competitive sibling rivalry things that you say and I've always seen Joseph

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
. Really doing well because to me his has taken that you

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
know he wants to do with his sisters. There's there's always that. And

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
. We've been fortunate because although they told me Joseph would never roll over

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
. Dr said that he would never sit up. Upon the

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
discharge of them. We went to a neurologist and an analogy set said to me

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Put him in a residence. And hope for the best and love the one that you can take

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
care. Referring to my daughter. Needless to

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
say that was not something that we were going to do. I gave birth to twins are going

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
to carry this. One. After four months in the hospital and

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
. A few back and forth visit hospital. Have a strong personality began with.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Them. But we weren't talking about my children. Especially you know

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
my son and I'm going to say my son my son is probably late

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
. But. In all fairness

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
my husband it's my daughter. So. You know he's got the girl and

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
he was. Saying.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
That. Joseph he was.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
They said that he would roll over he would never sit up.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
When he had the brain surgery. In the hospital room. Now Joey

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
said his left them.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
He now has right on his left hand so that but they put the I.V. in the right hand

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And. My point was is that I'm an advocate.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
After. Four months in the I.C.U. and back and forth was a lot

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
going on. And I have to get not to be trifled with. I. Just have

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
had the I.V. in the right hand. He had brain surgery. Who by the way he needed to

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
see a surgery at the same time because the hernia developed into a large scale. So my

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
twenty month old. Had stitches in his brain. Stitches in his going

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
. And was cutting forty's. And one would have to question. Just

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
. How fair that is. And they put the I.V. in my hand

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
that he needs to suck his thumb. And he couldn't. And I said

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
they have to you have to switch the F.A.A. or we can't do that Mr Prodi. I'm not asking you what you can and

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
can't do. I am telling you what needs to be done so that my son can calm himself.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
You're going to do that and you're going to do it now. Well we'll see. Get the

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
administrator right in there. I want to see that the chief surgeon this is not going to be

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
tolerated. We're not going to have my son in discomfort.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
They change the IP You know it's just it's.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
But you have to be that way and. It set the tone.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
For my son's entire future. Because.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Having a child with special needs because he's not. Behavioral.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
My son receives a diagnosis of cerebral palsy mental retardation. He's legally

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
blind even though the surgery didn't give him sight thank God. He still has

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
severely impaired vision. He can't emulate independently he requires

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
the assistance of a walker. But going back to that story where they said you know

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
relevant it was set up right after that brain surgery he's in the hospital finally they switched the

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I.V.. I'm sitting by his bedside and all of a sudden my son

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
sitting up. Something they said he would never do. So

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
we never let anybody tell us. What are some putative.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
My son has the will to do a lot. He's not that challenged

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
. We've said that over the years. He's motivated. He's proud

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
. And. What we need to do is give him the tools

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
. To continue. To develop and grow.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
So despite his health issues and everything else and you know the beauty of

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
having a twin sister that just isn't taken because. You know she's not taken any nonsense

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
you know that's a brother. It's not a kid with a disability that's a brother

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
she she has been a motivator. And has also

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
set me straight on many occasions when I don't want to send my son because why I do that you

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
. Have to do you're different than Joey. No one I. Know not. And you know as

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
they got older and his time Vault she would be. Now I want to can she want Joe to go

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
can I sit here but he can't tell me he can't you know he's nonverbal my son

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
He doesn't engage in conversation he's very. In. His own

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
happy world.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
He uses an i Pad now and then you know I wish I had it when he was four because I can only

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
imagine the abilities he would have to express himself had we had that school

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
so it's important that technology has done what it's done

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
because where he is now at twenty two twenty two.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Had he had the technology he has. Available to him. Just those twenty

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
years ago. I could see a different Joseph. And that's what we can lay

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
out the constant progress and we can say that anybody plateaus.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
There's always there's always hope. I mean and that's one of the things that we always want families to

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
know is that there's always hope. There's there's a lot of hard work

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
. But without that hope. You're going to lose yourself to

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
it. And. We can't let Joey. Half what he has in

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
his life be for nothing. You know his. His his presence in this world is

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
making a difference. He may not be out there you know making

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
touchdowns on the football field with. You know other his cousins

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
. But he's definitely impacting lives and. That's what we're here for.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
So his purpose and he's born with a purpose even though he's disabled

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
. He has that's his purpose his purpose is so that people can learn. Now I feel sorry for

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
him because there's no pity there's no. It's it's a purpose to

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
now look what you can if we can do this you can do. To me

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
I want to show it can I don't want to good care. I was afraid

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000
. And I go to can I suggest that you can come back and tell me she says

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
you're like I'm going to tell you. And she says

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
. What makes you think. My son my brother wants to be with you all the

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
time. I don't want to be with you all the time. Why should my brother have to be stuck with you all the time.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
She was really you know she was twelve thirteen she was being you know a smart alec you know twelve

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
thirteen year old so. We had to we go to King. And then of

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
course you know I had to vacation not ten minutes from where the camp

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
was. You know because after that episode with the hospital

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
. Needless to say any time Joseph had to do anything

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
. Even now they have to people have to let me know where he is. I need to know what my

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
son has so. You know whole cycle sometimes most of the time.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
And yeah I was like oh but he you know

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000
I need to know and.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
I'm fortunate that we've had fabulous people in our lives that have.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Made. A difference not just for my son but for me. And my husband

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
. And my daughter. You know it started out with teachers you know.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Jackie Romo was their first teacher. Jill McGrath was an O.T.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
. C.N.D. Garris. Alice Newman. That

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
to me. These these this this teen. When my children came

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
home. And Pat helped me become empowered. They

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
educated me in a field that I had no knowledge of. I mean I work for the

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
phone company. I had no no knowledge of disabilities whatsoever.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
I also there was organizations like parent to parent. That got on the

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
phone with me you know the parent of a child with cerebral palsy got on the phone me when I was.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Beside myself not knowing where I was going to go what I was going to do what to expect

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
. That type of. Connection. It

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
gives you not just a hope it's like OK. There's there's more to

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
this. It's not so terrible. It's not great not

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
to lie and say you know I would want it. But it's not. It's

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
not awful it's something that we can make a difference.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I had. Her name was Marie go pull shit on me for three hours.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
When my son was first put to a stand but because of my son at one point couldn't bear weight. On

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000
his own so he we had to put him in a standard It looked like if you've ever seen Young Frankenstein when the monster

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
strapped to a board and all I saw was my son strapped to a board

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
. And. It. Was devastating

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
devastating.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
I mean my son with glasses he was bilateral earphones he was laid braces you know

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
we've had you know the pediatric wheelchairs we there's all of that

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
. And you just kind of went through the motions but then when I saw my son

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
strapped to a board. Just to bear weight. It

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
. Put me over the edge and you know he said listen I work with this other little girl the mother's

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
part of parents parent but she's going to talk to you and my girlfriend I have to say

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
they took you off the roof.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
And she talked me out of the roof. Her daughter was older with cerebral

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
palsy and she had been there. So. How one

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
person can change a life. I truly believe that.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
It's also set the tone that you get what you give.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
And from believing that in this life time. I have been fortunate that I mean

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
able to give back. I have educated myself to be

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
a very good advocate not just for my son before other people with disabilities

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
. Because it's not just about my son. And I mean

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
right now this is about him. But our entire family isn't just about

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
. It's about helping the individuals that are in this world. That so

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
few have a voice and they need force. And I have a pretty big now

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
. So that kind of if it works out I was fortunate that

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.000
. When they were little I would volunteer as part of

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
. The committee on special education. I would feel. Here

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
on the P.T.A..

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
I actually met my best friend who might you know today I call my best

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
friend because she heard of me being somebody that can abdicate and she

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
said you know Jackie could you know could you get Jackie to Poti to come in and advocate for my

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
daughter I didn't know my daughter from an atom. But I I wasn't doing anything and I went to the

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
meeting and you know after that we met in different meetings in than we are now

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
best friends. So.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
By doing that you know it's you get that back you know and you're able to

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
help and then you're able to educate. So you know having Joseph in doing

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
you know so sick so early having them go through all the trials because didn't know how

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
to share of trials and tribulations and because her her special needs weren't

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
prominent is Josef's they couldn't be ignored. You know she had to laze in her gross motor

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
and she had a learning disability. She didn't come out unscathed yet she rose to the

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
occasion every time. And you know in school she needed that.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Testing modifications and you know we had to advocate for that because her needs weren't as

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
visible as Josef's.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
And you know she and she caught up and she says she's been doing and even now she's

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
graduating college in you know six weeks she's going to graduate in college but even in

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
college she knew to get extended time a lot of occasions and stuff like that

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
. And I've taught her to advocate for herself as well as advocate for her brother.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
And she does so. You know this is you know

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:20.000
some of it and I don't know I don't know what else I don't want to Tianjin about anything.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Is there anything else that you need to know about this is all really I mean I know

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
it's meant a lot for me to be able to sit here and listen you know to your story because I'm learning a

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
lot myself in this project as a whole as well. Because

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
. I want. To. Let me just ask you what your day to day is like now

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
with your son.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Well. Ironically this is being

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000
. This is something that well actually the

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:53.000
buzzing sounds OK. Well

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
. It's ironic that you should say this because. I'm just going to backtrack two

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
years two years ago I was diagnosed with breast cancer.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
I ended up having to. Hand.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Work and it ended up having that I ended up having like six surgeries in a

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
matter of five months. You know. The first thought when I got

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
diagnosed was that I was going to happen to my son I mean my worry about my daughter Don't get me wrong

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
But my son is home with me and he is a twenty four seven kidney Joseph still needs

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
assistance he needs to be fed toilet it changed. He's one hundred sixty

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
something pounds he's a big boy. That's it he's a man

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
. And he needs physical assistance to be lifted. And I couldn't

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
do that and that's the main anthemic surgery. So

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
I was fortunate that right after my surgery he went to camp for two weeks it's a good thing my daughter told

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
me because now I was able to send them to camp without you know really gone crazy.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
He's at Camp for two weeks then came home and then we had a staff of people coming in helping.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
We have community have workers that come in. And there are

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
people coming and going you know as I'm laid up with dreams and you know what

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
kind of you know stitches you know I could barely you know get out of bed

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
myself. But they were there helping them.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Two years. Fast forward. I've recovered you know I'm cancer free

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
. I am. You know doing well I've had my last surgery was

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
useless December and I'm doing OK. I can't let my son

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
. As a result of. The surgeries I have

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
scar tissue holes and I can hurt myself

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
if I left my son and I do a fight and I look I have to he has to be

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
showered he has to be taken care of. But it's become where it's

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
not safe for my son. So my son was put on. It's called priority one list

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
with the state of New York for him to move into a residential group

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
home. In the end of February.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
This was a year year and he was put on the last year and a half ago. I'm. Like a

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
year after my surgery. We just we can't do it just it's just not

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
safe. So a year and a half ago we put on the list. There's been no

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
opportunities and this is where it comes into play. There's no opportunities for individuals

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
who need twenty four seven to have a place to live. It's just the state is now

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
funding it. There's nowhere to go. I was

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
scheduled to speak at a breakfast we had started on disability Council does a part first every

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
year. They asked if I would speak on you know what it is to have somebody on the list

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
and has nowhere to go. Ironically and sadly that same week somebody

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
passed away you know and an opportunity has been presented to my son

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
. Somebody had to die for my son to have a place to live

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
It's sad and. I'm sad for the family who lost

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
somebody and. That's the reality

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
. So as of today we

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
are now working on transitioning my son to go live in a

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
residential group home. With other individuals who are lower

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
functioning than us. Who have much more medical needs than he does

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
. It is not the ideal location for me to have my son with

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
it is not what I had planned for him.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
It is not. What I want to do at this stage in my life

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
. But like other families who have people with disabilities I don't have a

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
choice. I'm. I could advocate left and right for him to live

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
in a different house but my son needs barrier free. He can't live in a house that had

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
stairs. My son needs twenty four hour seven day we care

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
A lot of the houses that are out there don't have that.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Had I died on the table which there were complications and I am listed

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
what would have happened to my son. If something happens to me going forward

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
. Who says that that decision is then going to fall on my daughter I don't want

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
that. Should take care of I know she would jump she would take care

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
. That's. That's her brother. She did not give birth to him. My

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
husband is just you know of the same mindset you know he actually had a job where he used to travel a lot.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
He had to stop working that job and take a cut in pay so

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
that he could be home to help with Joseph because I can't do it and there's

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
nothing more humbling. To know that you can take care of your child. Especially

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
that that's what you want to do and you can't you

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
physically can't. And I'm no different than a lot of families

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
who have aging parents and older people with disabilities. And

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
. I dare I say I'm fortunate that Joseph is going to have this opportunity.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
But it's heartbreaking and. It's these past

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
few weeks and you say day to day every day. I honestly

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:35.000
sincerely cry. I feel sad I feel her

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000
. I wonder if I'm doing the right thing and. I feel like

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
I'm starting over again. I'm starting over second guessing what am I going

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
to do. I want to have my son live a happy life.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Am I doing the right thing. I feel like I'm back when he came out of hospital and I

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
doing the right thing to actually treat it and you second guess yourself and all the confidence that

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
I've accumulated over the past twenty years being their parent and I

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
say trying because the first you're doing.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
It seems to go right out the window no matter what people

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
tell you they'll tell you all you find you can do great all you'll be fine

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
. There's always a pressure. I have to

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
do this right. I can't afford to screw so I

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
can't this is my son's life. TO DAY TO

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
DAY This morning we get up and get Joseph out of bed. Sadly if we don't get him out of

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
bed in time he soaked because he can't get himself to the bathroom.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
He just sleep in polo. He doesn't work while he's sleeping.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
He'll get up but he doesn't call out so when he gets up he and his manner and you know

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
with changing shoes you know changing sheets this morning and changing him. He's a

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
twenty two year old young man who full grown that empties his bladder

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
. So I'm cleaning him and you know making sure that he's fine.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Then he goes and he's on his i Pad and he is happy and he's singing

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
I get ready for work my husband gets ready for work we wait for the van because he goes to an

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
adult day program on your mark. My son goes to Anya mark because that's an appropriate

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.000
program for him. Lifestyles is great but it's not right for him and that's about

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
knowing the difference of what's right and what's not right. You know your kid.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
And so the vandal pick him up take him to program.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
I then go to work and look you know I'm fortunate to work in the field and I came upon this job

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
because I used to volunteer and help. And when there was an opportunity somebody

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
asked me to help and you know it just it pays it forward I have to say I think

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
it does pay it forward. So then now at a certain time

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
on a given day if Joe gets out a program by two thirty three o'clock I have to make sure I'd leave work early

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
because I have to make sure I get home for him because there's you can't have Grandma get him off the Wii and

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Joseph is one hundred sixty two pounds. He needs you to assist him.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Neither my mother or my mother in law have that kind of strength to take characters

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
so it's just me and my husband's job now

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
that where he is where he actually works the lifestyles my husband he does support professionals.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
It's as does my daughter she works here in the summer but.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
We're dedicated to the people that we serve. You know where we're not just about

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
jobs I mean OK Rob Joseph is first. But we

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
care we care about happens and we know when we treat somebody

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
in a program that's how we want our son treated. That's how they you know want a brother treated

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
respect that's what you give them so you know I'll take care of and then he'll have

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
community have workers in our community have work will come and work with Joseph on Gholston two different

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
things take him out and they'll work with Joseph and I

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
have people Joseph it's been lucky he's very service rich as I said I've become a

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:18.000
very very good advocate for my son. He gets twenty hours of community have a week

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
so I literally have people in my house seven days a week.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Whether it be from five three four five o'clock in the afternoon till five till nine

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
o'clock at night Saturday and Sunday. There's always somebody in my house. So

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Joseph is always. Has somebody. We're working on goals we don't do

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
this for babysitting and I want to babysit or they work closely work on how Joseph can

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000
type. Joseph can read Joseph can type. Joseph is

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
very capable of a lot of things and because he's nonverbal a lot of people

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
dismiss his abilities and my job is to make sure that they don't

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
and you can't take anything just because something is quite You can't take for granted but they

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
can and can't do now. So then you know take care Joseph. The

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
staff that we have work is what helped us over the showering which is you know relief to me

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
. But if somebody cancels. If there's a

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
snowstorm. Here you know I have one of the staff now she's pregnant

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
she has a baby and you know she's going to get to the point where she can't live Josephine

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
. So it's just there's that type of stuff going on to now

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
going forward. We're trying to transition Joseph to go to this group home

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
. Where you make plans like every week that he goes for a couple hours.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
So you get used to his new house. Jess is going to have a new room.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Yes. So. He says he's starting to get acclimated

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
. As my husband and I are now we've always thought that Joseph was going to be moving

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
into a resident when we knew that that's going to be the real goal

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
that now this particular residence at this particular time of my life but you know

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
when he gets on the pitch you got to take the ball sometimes.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
And. JOSEPH. Has been going to a residential respite

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
once a month for a weekend so he can get acclimated to other people caring for him. We've

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
done the camp again like I said my daughter has been instrumental in doing that

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
five years ago we adopted my niece.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Theresa she was fourteen

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
. We took her in.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
And she has been a mainstay is you know somebody who cares about Joseph and

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
yes our family grew a little bit too and then I have to mention we have two dogs we have

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
two laboratories we have made it in sunshine and some Chinese jelly stock

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
and you know Joseph Listen I called me mommy mommy. Like chill sunshine

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
sunshine and heat up in sunshine.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
You want to go with me tonight but he does it with sunshine that is dark and

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
you know so we have a close knit family and the staff that comes to our house

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
are now become like an extended part of our family. And Joe and my husband I was

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
saying like when Joe moves out they're not going to come any more. Where

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
now for the first time in our marriage. We're not going to have

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
people in and out of our homes and Danielle is going to be twenty two and Teresa is

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
nineteen and there are two in a tank and John and I are looking at each other like life is

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
going to change and that's scary. And

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
. You know. We don't want to be selfish about Joseph.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Going OK I was being selfish you know to second guess what we're going to do

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
so but so day in the life this is struggling with

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
decisions no matter and it doesn't matter what you just live there you know.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Is it being taken care of. Are they making sure that the children between his toes

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:11.000
they you know they are they cutting his fingernails too short you know where they

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
shave him you know just like you take for granted that you do

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
that somebody else is going to have to do so and I am such a control freak

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
control freak.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
So to relinquish control is also

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000
very difficult.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Although I can be a fabulous advocate to relinquish that control

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
. I find to be very difficult because I guess I had so little

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
control when they were born I was assumed total control

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
And. You know if somebody says we use our powers for good and we

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
want to make sure that you know I have very confident children are very confident if you

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
ask my son who's better than you he will tell you nobody. My

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
daughter has an arrogance about her you can ask anybody who works at last I'll tell

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:05.000
you.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Danielle takes no no.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Sometimes even from the participants because they're people they're not people with

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
handicapped people and I think that's a good you know with what you guys are

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
doing I think the most important message is to remember that we're talking about people

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
and you know I'm grateful to you know share my story. You know

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
there's a there's a whole thing maybe one day I will write a book and put it on the public library

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
books. Yeah totally. Maybe it would be fun. So do you have any

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
other things that you need to know

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
. I do have one more question and if you could think of mothers like

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Result years and years from now maybe before their children are even

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
born what would you what would you tell them or what would you tell younger version of

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000
yourself.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Try to trust your instincts. Trust your instincts.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
You know who you are. When it comes to your child

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
. You know your child better than anybody else even before

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000
they're born even when you're planning on having a baby and you want to do

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
things your way. I know I can respect what everybody has done in the past

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
you know you mother your mother in law or they've all done that done this. Trust your

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
instincts become confident in knowing that you're a good mother to

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
start. Because you you've made a choice to bring a life into the world. That's not an

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000
easy choice. So that's that's what I would suggest you do.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:43.000
And thank you so much for sharing your story and the press. Corps.
