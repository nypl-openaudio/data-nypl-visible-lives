00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello, my name is Monica Diaz, and I'm going to have a conversation with Ash

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Faith for Visible Lives, an oral history project at the New

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
York Public Library. Today is January 13th, 2015,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and this is being recorded at the New York public office,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
public library office near midtown Manhattan. And

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
can you start by telling us a little bit about yourself?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Hi, guys. My name is Ash Faith

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and, boy, where do I begin? Um.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I have a traumatic brain injury.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I entered a two-month

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and woke up randomly thinking I was into

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
work when I was really in a back brace in a hospital bed

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and I ... after waking ... that was in

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
August 2010. The

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
accident was in June 2010, so two-month coma....

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I mean, wake up afterwards and I then stayed in

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
both a hospital and a rehabilitation facility for the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
duration of the year. And I actually had to

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
bounce from the facility that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I was in because medical cruelty.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So. [laughs.]

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
my, um, my school of hard

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
knocks, per se, was not only the medical cruelty but

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
also leaving an institution

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
early and, going with the punches

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in New York City in whatever way it came.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
That must have been difficult. How ...

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Tell me a little bit more about your time in the rehab facility

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and how ?inaudible? 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Well, I mean. Um, even though I woke up in the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
hospital, it was in rehabilitation unit, so....

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
My accident. Was on June, June

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
sixth, 2010. Three weeks after graduating college.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It was just one of those situations where I was at the wrong place at

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the wrong time, and I

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
ended up being in the same car as a drunk driver, and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
he ended up crashing into a pole on a

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
major highway, and because I didn't have my

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
seatbelt on, being in the back seat, I ended up flying through the

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
window into the woods. My skull and

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
brain sheared against each other, and I flew

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
so far they couldn't find me for a minute.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
But they found me, and I was in a nasty

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.000
coma.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
For those two months, obviously my family and friends were all

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
alerted, and thankfully I had just

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
the right kind of support that I needed during that

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
time.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
When I woke up on August fifth, 2010, it

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
was...it was just like... I was so confused. For

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
like the first week. Between my past memories before the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
accident, colliding with the present

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
circumstances.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I was just confused most of the time, and like, thankfully

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
it's in my nature to just go with the flow. So

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I adapted, I adopted that mentality and

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
while there was a lot of ups and downs, um, I'm thankful to have

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
made it this far.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Five years later.  "Yeah. It's been five years."

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Other than your family, like, where else did you get that support system

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
system?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Family and friends, and I work with some

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
doctors, um. You know, doctors, some...

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Each doctor has, like, a way of showing their

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
care and ...

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
was...

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I'm very thankful that I've worked with the right types of doctors 'cause even

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
though the care varied and, and like, 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
dedication and, like, emotions and all that

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and did what I needed to do, and then... aside from a little ?mental? cruelty.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
that's... That wasn't even from doctors. That was from lame nurses who

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
just didn't know how to, like, treat their patients, but, like, it

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
was, I mean, I don't want to get graphic but, I mean,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
you're like an infant again, so I was again potty-trained

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and I don't have nurses

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
like, literally make fun of me for being in my early

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
twenties, brain-damaged, and, like, and going through

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
this process that was indeed painful in retrospect.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Emotionally. "Emotionally, yeah."

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Well, the shit hit the fan when a

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
nurse ended up pushing my wheelchair against the wall.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So I proceded to say fuck you to her. And she said, Fuck me?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
No, fuck you. And she gyrated her ass in my face like a cheap porn star.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Oh, my goodness.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
"Yeah." "I'm sorry." "It's, it is what it is."

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Like, being able to cope and move on, you know,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and I can just, like, remember it, I mean, like, that was distasteful

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
but like....

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Were any other of your peers or any other patients also 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
experiencing  some of those, some of that harassment? "Actually"

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Well I feel like, I'm the membership coordinator of the Brain

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Injury Association in New York City, so the past couple of years has

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
allowed me to connect with others that I have the same brain

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
injury. The only thing with brain injuries is that it affects

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
everyone that has it individually. So it's, like, it's a very

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
unique, like, for example, my brain injury wouldn't be the same as your brain

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
injury, God forbid. Or like another person with a brain injury. We 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
all show signs of it differently.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And a lot of it has to do with social environments,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
in the home environments, like.... So I

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
ended up connecting with, 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
with a gay male that also has a brain injury.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
He's, like, ten to twenty years older than me

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and he actually ended up in that same hospital and he

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
was just like

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
You survived place too? I'm like, yeah, dude, I'm like, and we're just

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
comparing our timetables and, like, it was like right when I left,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
he entered, like, a few months later. So it was just, it was just crazy.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But he also had, like, a deep disdain for his

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
experiences there. The only perks of that place was the therapies.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Because they have good doctors.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Yeah. The nurses, I hope they get their act together.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And, and so you mentioned that the therapies, you really liked those, right?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Sorry, are you still doing some of that? "Yeah, I took, I took a

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
hiatus. I, I don't know. Well

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
gosh, that's kind of a lengthy story. Well, when I got

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
out of the nursing home I was

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
only able to get my rehabilitation therapies

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
arranged, like, within a couple of months, and then there

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
was, well, dealing to doctors was pretty cool

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and, like, Russ was right. I went and go again

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
as of today but anyway like I ended

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
up having to deal with not institutional violence through them

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
but through like Access-A-Ride, different ambulette services...

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I mean, one of them was named Dedicated and they were the

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
opposite of that. And.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Access-A-Ride just wouldn't show up, like, I mean, they just don't, they're very

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
notorious for that. Like, yeah, it's an amazing resource for New York City to

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
have, especially if you have a disability,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
but show up, you know. "You're counting on them." Because we've got no other

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
choice but to count on them and when they just, like,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
won't show up on time to take you to your

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
therapies, they'll run that pace where it isn't them,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
it's you. And one of

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
the therapies that I had back

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
then that I'm seeing, that I started again today actually,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
occupational therapy. Well it was amazing

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and beneficial. It got me that, like, three strikes, you're

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
out type of deal because I would, like, not show up on time and

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
it would be beyond my control, especially then. I was like, I

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
would be in my lobby, waiting for like forty-five minutes to an hour just to

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
go to therapy and that, I mean, even though patience is a therapy in

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
itself, that wasn't part of the agenda.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Yeah.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
It sounds like, you know, from your experience you've kind of become an advocate for

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
this community, people who suffer from these type of injuries. How, how have

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
you brought that into your role as a coordinator?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Well. "Tell me a little bit more about your..." Well, the coordinator part

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
part is super fresh.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Like, I was a sociology

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
major and... "Me, too." Oh

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And so I have a lot of experience with, like, social activism

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and advocacy and all that.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And I kind of just, like, use this notion of lived

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
experience as my anchor to

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
recover and regenerate from this

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
injury and of course it had multiple

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
phases that I went through.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I'm very grateful to be in a phase where I can, like, connect

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
with the city, with the state, with the world if I can.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:39.000
But, you know, if I want to. And a lot of

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
people would see that drive in me, but they just, like, I

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
mean, well they would be supportive. They would also be, 

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
like, concerned that I would, like, relapse

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
in ways, in ways that I used to live my life before my

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
accident. I was just very daring. I wasn't, like,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
a drug addict, thankfully, I never made it to that extreme

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
but I sort of see it with a lot of, with a lot of addicts, with a lot of

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
people from different sides in the world.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And while there's no regrets with that, the lifestyle that I led

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
was a little bit daring, if not, like, self-

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
exploitive. I would just, I would just be on, like,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
thin ice with some of my actions. But just like I lived and learned

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
through them, I also chose to

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
live and learn through my experiences in the city

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.000
afterward.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
So you wake up on August 5th, you think you're late for work, right?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Uh-huh.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
But, you know, you... There's something else that happened right

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
after that, right? You, you were living this daring life. What, what did you, what were

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
some of the biggest lessons you learned, you know, in your journey to recovery?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Trust. I mean, I used to

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
think that... I just used to have a sense of righteous resistance

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
where I would be, like, very in your face, like, get

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
out of my way, please and thank you type of

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
guy and

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I just don't think that I applied a sense

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
of wisdom to my actions.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So I absorbed a lot of people's actions

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
as a way to navigate my own, and there

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
was just inevitable consequences that came along with that.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
My accident and my disability

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
were climactic, in the sense where

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
not only was, did I, was I able to, like,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
down or sit down and, like, have to confront my demons, like,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
no escape. There was also my loved ones

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
are different,  different friends and family that were just, like,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
having to not only confront

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
my demons as, like, a secondary presence but

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
also, like, but also confront their own.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And, you know, it was just like a very two-way

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
inter-crossing interdependent type of

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
scenario that was occurring.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
What was the hardest thing about the recovery?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I mean, aside, it was... The hardest thing was, is

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
was feeling abandoned or neglected. Even though I had

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
the right kind of support when I was in the hospital, coming out, coming

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
back into the city...

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Everyone that supported me in the hospital just made a cameo appearance, you know, it

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
was like, and, like, no shame in that, like, you know, I'm

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
twenty-eight, and I was twenty-, I wasn't even twenty-five when this started

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
happening so even though I had, like, an unyielding

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
support, there was just this, 

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
like, inevitable independence that, like,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
paved a path for everyone, including myself,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
that I had to recognize, and you know

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
before my accident, I was an escapist, for sure, and

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
I would, I would escape into the company of

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
others. But with this

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
disability, even though I had the support from others,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
the only love that I had to encounter in the end was love for

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
myself and supporting myself in my

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
drive to, to get to where I am. "That's beautiful."

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Thanks.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And so, you know, I want to actually take it back a little

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
bit. I don't think I asked you about your experience growing

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
up.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
You mentioned you've been here in New York but what brought you

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
here. Tell me a little bit about growing up.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
I, I lived a pretty sheltered yet

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
awesome lifestyle. You know my parents did their

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
best raising me. No complaints. There was

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
always, like, literal... I was born with

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
hereditary sensory motor neuropathy

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
but... It's also known as Charcot Marie Tooth.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
And, but there was no definition or diagnosis.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
for it when I was growing up. Between the ages of, like,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
yeah, I think, five, after, like, five

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
and then eleven and then

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
sixteen.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
I had strokes, where I would just be chillin',

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
like, you know, minding my business with family or friends and then, like,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
half my face would become paralyzed. And no one would know what to do and, 

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
like, when I lived in the city and, I was eleven when it happened.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
You were here in New York.  "I was in New York at the time and it happened again when I was in the suburbs at, like,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
sixteen or seventeen, but it happened when I was, yeah, and like

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
sixth grade, and it was so scary. So then, you know,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
my parents took me to get looked at, but doctors only...

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
They had diagnosed me with, like, a symptom

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
of the Hereditary, 

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
of the neuropathy, and the symptom is hypotonia, which is

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
decreased muscle tone. So it would be like, Oh, that

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
makes sense why he's super skinny and has, like, hyper-flexible

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
wrists and is just as clumsy as Steve Uriel.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Like, like that was...

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
But, but hypotonia was a symptom of, like, a bigger

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
thing and that bigger thing wasn't diagnosed until

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
I was twenty-three, six

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
months before my accident. I was, I went to school at SUNY

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Purchase in Westchester but I had, I

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
would, like, work at a denim boutique on the weekends in SoHo,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
and it was a cool lifestyle to lead at the time.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
However that sense of, like, always being on the go

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
affected my coordination and my, even my, like,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
motion.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And so I went to get checked up, and I was,  I have this thing

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
called hypotonia. You ever hear of it, Doc? And he was just, like,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
That's not a diagnosis.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
He was, like, Yeah, well, that's like a symptom of a

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
diagnosis. It's not what you may or

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
may not have.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
So he ended up, like, doing tests on me.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
And he came up with Charcot Marie Tooth, which has been renamed as Hereditary

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Sensory Motor Neuropathy, which makes much sense when you say it... "All this time"

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
When you say it like that. And I'm, like, Wow. Wow. And, like,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
then there was the riddle of, like, oh, which parent can it come from? But, like,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
neither of my parents showed signs of it. And if they did, it

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
was, like, super subtle, like, it was, like, I'm just, like,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
diving, like, head straight into it, because this T.B.I.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
is definitely an icing to the cake.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
How, how have they, I mean, how have you dealt

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
with both of these things now? "Oh, I was bummed from that. I was super-bummed.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
I mean, aside from, aside from being a misfit before my

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
accident, you know, I just, even though I was a social butterfly, 

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
like, I was also a hopeless romantic, so, you know,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
just being, like, an extroverted gay male.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
since I was fifteen. And having to, like, not

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
only deal with, like, the cues of social rejection but also like, a

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
body, that type of rejection.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
It was so interesting because I didn't have an answer for it and I just

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
have like likeminded friends who

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
could appreciate me for me

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
and vice versa.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
But it was always that, like, any time, like, you would see me run or you would see me

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
or just like, you know, coordinate myself, you would be, like, You're so cute and flimsy.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000
And I'd be, like, Thanks. ?Friends? of showing Steve Urkel on

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Friday nights when I was a kid.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
That was my, like, immediate way, to, like, you know,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
recognize it. But, when I was a, you know, not

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
this official diagnosis six months before my

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
accident, while studying S&M for my thesis,

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
senior thesis, that I was just, like...

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
But... It was...

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
I feel like, when I came

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
out, let's see, I was back home in, like, January

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
2011. So six months later, and then

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:19.000
by the summertime, even though I had a

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
routine going, like, my outpatient therapies, even ??

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
services.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Dealing with, like, ambulette cruelty

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
was like a wake-up call that the city ain't this, like,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
you know, lovey-dovey place, and, like, being a native, I knew

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
that at the heart, but, like,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Can't you even cut a dude with a cane or a walker some slack. One time,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Oh my gosh. I'll never forget this. Sorry to be on a tangent, but, like,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
it happened, I think within 2011, like the end of 2011, beginning of 2012

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
I ditched the ambulette services and had the courage to

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
start navigating the subways on my own. "Ah" Yeah, I just, like, didn't call.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
I was, like, you know, I not gonna call them, I'm not even gonna call my mom. I'll just

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
do this, so I took my cane and I just ended

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
up, you know, going out. I was just mindful how I went down the steps

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
but it was fun. It was, like, easier than I thought. And one

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
time, I was on 34th Street and Herald Square

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
and I was in rush hour and, it was, you know, I was crossing

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
the street and this stranger just, like, saw me and she helped

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
me cross the street so I could dodge the cars. She was, like, some people are

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
assholes. And I'm, like, Yeah, thanks for the help.  So, you know,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
having that hope was awesome. And then, no joke, like twenty minutes later I'm

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000
on the subway, and this guy, 

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000
like, you know, in a really, like, tight blue vest is just, like

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
walking up the stairs in the rush-hour crowd, and I'm going down the stairs

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
and he just pushed me to the side, and I didn't fall down the

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
stairs, thank God, but he was like, he was in, like, such rapid

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
mode that he just, like, pushed me out of the way.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
And like, I was, like, saved ?by those scenes.?  It was like crowd-

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
surfing. "Crowd-surfing." Yeah,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000
and, thankfully, you know, there was, like,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
you know, I mean, caring

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
New Yorkers that were helping me out, but I was just, like, What just happened?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
That was your first... "It was my first time." ...time?

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
My first... It wasn't the first actual time, but it was, like, the first day

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Of 

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
being underground and I was, like, Whoa. "Well, I've been

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
living in New York for about a year now, and I've definitely encountered both the

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
nastier side of people and just really

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
awesome people who will go out of their way, out of their way to help

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
or just even smile. There's just... "Totally. Totally."

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
So tell me about you, pre and post

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
the injury. How has it changed your experience as a

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
New Yorker? What do you think? How has the city kind of, other than those

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
stories, how has it embraced or helped you?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
I think I always had it in my nature

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
to, I just always had a drive, you know, even when I

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000
lived in the suburbs and I got my license, I'd be driving

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
places like that. People'd be like, Why do you have to

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
you know. "You're exploring." Yeah, exactly, so that's in my nature. To explore

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
and, in

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
New York City, like, the ways that I would explore before the

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
accident compared to after the accident are different.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
I, I'm a meditation teacher now,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
but I have undergone a meditative

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
lifestyle for sure after my accident, that

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
I flirted with before but, you know, I would

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
be, like, some dessert to, like, you

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
know, the adventure cake

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
and New York... I feel like New York is different in the sense

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
that, like, a

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
lot of people, it's like, a lot of people that aren't

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
from New York are now living in New York, and, like, there's just this

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
cohabitation happening. And there's so many social

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
frontiers, like gentrification and all that.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
My experience coincides more

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
with, like, institutional presence. So it's like my

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
presence as a disabled person within

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
different institutions. The first institution

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
that I found and thankfully grew with,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
with their help, was, it's called the Anti-Violence Project

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
and they're, like, a few blocks away from here.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
And that, being with them

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
enabled me to exercise my voice

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
beyond somebody going to speech therapy for a traumatic brain injury, even though

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
that was amazing too. Like,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
they had trained me in hotline counseling,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
public speaking, and

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
they also helped me unravel certain instances

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
of violence that I was exposed to before on my accident that I didn't

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
necessarily have much of a voice to articulate and if I did, it was more

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
of a fuck you, get out of my way type of deal, but, you know, I was able to,

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
like, process all these, all this

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
variety of emotion that

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
was anchored by violence, to say the least.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
What kind of violence? "Well, I mean, my car

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
accident, the car accident that I was in had traces

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
of

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
intimate partner violence. I was in a, I wasn't

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
really involved, like hardcore, with the person but it was

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
just the person was like an anchor

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000
towards my desire for other men. We've known each other since I was

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
fourteen so between the history with that

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
and our experiences together and, like, the history of past experiences

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
that are unrelated to him, the fact that it

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
all culminated to getting thrown out

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
a window, you know, and I having my head and

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
brain flirt with each other for

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
a few minutes was scary. I'm like, whoa,

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
and you know, surviving the coma. I had a very vivid near-death

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
experience that I talk about in the books that I'm

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
writing. And...

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Tell me about that incident, or are you not ready to talk about it? "No, I totally could.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
About the near-death experience?" The near-death experience...yeah.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Yeah yeah. Or tell us about even your books.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Well, for starters, for my near-death experience,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
I thought heaven was a VIP lounge and I was getting denied.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Yeah, I was, I thought I was getting rejected from a club.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
?Resented some of the chilling glow,? like all the other souls that I was

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
witnessing and my

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
mental landscape and it was just a very

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
real, surreal experience to say the least.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
I'm currently writing...

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
I started writing my four books when I was in the hospital

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
actually. My process in writing these books first and foremost

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
is to hand write them in multiple note-

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
books, using the stream of

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
consciousness method and three of the

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
books--they're called ?Laddie? Stardust,  Freeze,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
and Jay Gaze ?Gays? And Laddie

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Stardust explores this notion of daring 

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
innocence.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:03.000
So it's, it just, it talks about

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
my life, like how I grew up in this

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
safe world and how I was just like

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
hungry to be unbound by that type of

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
safety and as a result experience what I did.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
And Freeze is kind of like an ode to my trauma.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Because even though I have this traumatic brain

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
injury that I survived, a year and a half before

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
my accident, I was assaulted and I got P.T.S.D.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.000
.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
So, you know, trauma was no

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
stranger to me when I was, received this diagnosis. So

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Freeze is, explores this notion of, like,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
being. The character is a renegade intellectual

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
and just absorbs all this knowledge with his lived experience

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
and process it, processes it

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
through a traumatic bias, which is

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
ironically to freeze or to fight or flight.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
And Jay Gaze it is a sci-fi novel about

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
blossoming in a post-modern society.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
I'm writing these down. "Cool. Thanks." When are, when is the

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
release date? "I'm aiming, I'm aiming for Laddie to be

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
released sometime this year." Great. "I'm gonna get working hardcore on it."

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Great, great.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
So you also you mentioned your work as a

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
meditation teacher, right?. How... Are you still, do you still

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
practice that or

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Totally, totally. "Tell me a little bit more about that." Wow, well, OK. I found

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
meditation three years before my accident. I was

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
getting stoned with some good friends and practicing kundalini yoga.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
And I was a little ?fucked? I won't lie.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
It wasn't genuine meditation. It wasn't a practice per se, you know.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
And so I experienced that, and it

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
it ended, like, you know

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
cycle of life style. And then my

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
senior year of college,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
I was, I had survived my P.T.S.D. incident,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
so I started seeing a therapist and he introduced me to mindfulness. And

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
he would kind of incorporate that in our sessions.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Plus, a couple of sociology teachers were getting big on it too,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
so they would use it in their classes. So yeah.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Senior year was all about, like, studying S&M and

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
discovering mindfulness and, like, and then my accident happened

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
three years, three weeks later and I remember waking up from my

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
coma like the first week, and kinda like absorbing the basic

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
info of what had happened. And I'm like, All right. This

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
is No time like the present. I'm gonna start exercise my

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
mindfulness and I got mindful all right all throughout

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
my hospital stay. And then the more distracted I became,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
whether it was through, like, you know, movies or, you

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
know,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
I would just go off to la-la land sometimes.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
That is what it is. My meditation practice

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
strengthened a little bit beyond

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
mindfulness like a year later

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
when I followed the lead for this flier that said

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Meditation and showed a shiny

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
brown, bald man in the field and I'm like, oh, this guy looks cool. 

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
I want to see what this is about. And it was at a

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000
elementary school a couple of blocks away from where one of my

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
best friends used to live in the Village, and I was thinking, Aw,

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
this has, like, a home, sweet home type of scenario.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
And I ended up learning about this man

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
who was a guru named Sri Chinmoy.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
He was, like, super big in the Seventies and Eighties and

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Nineties.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
And even though he had passed away, and I was seven

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
I believe his disciples just, like, continued

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
to spread his message were allied. So this is one of those cases

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
where the disciples were showing documentaries of him

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
and they had this new art therapy that I have,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
like, a deep respect for, so I'm like, oh, you know, between the art therapy...

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Next thing you know, I get invited to their headquarters and

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
I start meditating with them. And that was some. So towards the end

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
they were like, OK you can't, you have

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
to become a disciple

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
in order to continue to meditate with us. So I was...

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Because to be a disciple, you have to wear all white and claim celibacy, which I

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
wasn't ready to do at twenty-five, so

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
I ended up going to this coffee house down the street. And there's a

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
flier that said, Learn to Meditate. The Interdependence Project.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
And coincidentally, a good buddy of mine that I went to

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000
college with,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
like, that night had posted something

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
about The Interdependence Project

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
so, the next

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
class was, like, a few days later

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
and I ended up making it. And I had to go up, like,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000
this,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:58.000
this

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
super narrow flight of stairs that I can only describe

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
if you see it and, like, I just have

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
this, like, mountain of stairs ahead of me, and I'm like, Alright, no time 

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
like the present, and took my cane, made it up

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
there and... "Very symbolic, almost." Yeah, totally, and

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
And I was able to continue my meditation

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
practice through them. This was in the summer of 2012 and

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
by 2013 I had entered their immersion

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
meditation teacher training program.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
That was just a life-changing experience, and then all through

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
2014, with their help and with the help of a good friend

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:00.000
that had just opened up a yoga studio downtown I was able to

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
get some meditation classes rolling.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000
And then I, the president of the

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Brain Injury Association of New York City ended up inviting

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
me to teach meditation to the

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000
members for a couple of events.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
And that

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
warmed me up to them, and it got me further involved with the

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
association. It strengthened

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
It strengthened my knowledge and

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
meditation practice with The Interdependence Project as well as

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Dharma Punx, who's another meditation group that

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
meets there on alternate days and

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
now I'm still chillin' there. I'm, like, 

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
assisting their Monday night Buddha psychology classes and

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
lovin' it. "Great."

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
So you're, you're quite an achiever.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
How,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
how have you used this experience to

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
maybe

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
influence but provide me, provide some advice not just to your younger

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
brother. You mentioned you have a sibling. "Yeah." I don't know if you have... "I have three younger brothers. Yeah."

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
So how have you used this experience to maybe share some advice

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
with other people or what, how have you,

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
kind of...

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
"I mean." ...helped others through their, through their path?

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
I, that's funny, I'm, like, going through that with

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000
I'm going

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
I am trying to form, oh,

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
trying to form a way to do that in my head currently. "OK."

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
I feel like not bowing down is my

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
instant advice.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
It's also the advice that has gotten me by all this time.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
I, I'm just not the type to bow down, and the best

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
advice that I can give anyone is to do that whenever they feel

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
limited or confined by

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
either their environment or by what others could say to

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
them.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
?warrants no? boundaries because, you know, you can

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
bow down, boundless, you can not bow down

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
boundlessly all you want but creating a sense

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
of boundary is so important, for recovery, for 

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
communicating.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
And I feel like you learn that through lived experience.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
And

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
as for a prime intention, the thing I always say to people is

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Ignite the light. "Ignite the light. I like that." Thanks.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
So aside from meditation

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
or your work with

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
the Brain Injury Association, what else do you do in your free time?

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000
I art model and I,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
that was something I did before my accident, and

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:56.000
I think the way you realize that was something I could do after my

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
accident at the Art Students League of New York,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
and I'm, I'm a pretty creative person,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
so I like that this job, like, enables me to

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
be creative, whether it's through photography, whether it's by giving me

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
the time to exercise poetry.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
It's, it's just boundless. I like that. 

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
The job with...? "With the Art Students League. Yes." Yes. "And

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:36.000
also with, it compliments my meditation practice

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
and meditation teaching. ?These? also

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
meditate and model at the same time. Though a lot

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
people don't realize that because I just do what I have to do to

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
strike a pose

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
at work and it's cool, that.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.000
in

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
What are the next steps? What's your five- or ten-year plan?

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:14.000
(laughing)

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
My, my four books out there, definitely within five

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
years. My

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
book that I'm working on that I didn't mention before, it's called In Dust

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000
and it talks about,

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.000
it talks about... It's like a social commentary

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
on post-modern society and how we can

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
thrive with it or just stay under the

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
radar, whichever way we choose.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
It's definitely in construction, but...

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
I'm hoping to grow as a

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000
model,

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
as well from art modeling to photography. I used to do photography

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000
when I was in college. Like, I used to pose for

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
photographers.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
That was fun. It's like a different type of,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
it's a different kind of fun. It's just, like,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Not as still, per se, and

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000
just explore the world one step at a time.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
You mentioned you really like to, you've always had that in you.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Yeah, I mean, I want to be able to travel

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
and I want to... I don't want

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
to feel so bound by the work that I give myself. You know, I want to just

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:02.000
like, enjoy the world and interact with all

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
these different types of people and connect them any which way I can.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000
I don't even meditation to do that. I'm all about the

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
interpersonal thriving. "Where would you want to go?"

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Oh. I can't really go back. I 

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
visit my motherland of Peru.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Ah. Very nice.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Have you, have you been recently or what was the last...? "I haven't been to Peru

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000
in fifteen years." Wow. "Yeah, so I would love to

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
go back and just explore.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Explore Spain. "What about Mexico?"

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000
It's so funny. I was just, I was just talking to an art model about

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000
just talking to an art model who's from Mexico and she's like, You gotta

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
see, go to the beaches there.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Yeah, I'm into that. And I would just love to explore Mexico too.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
And Colombia and, yeah, I love that.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000
I went to Peru last year and I,

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
I'm sure you'll be just as impressed as I was. "Oh, nice." There's just so many

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000
cultures within, and just landscapes

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000
within. So. "It's a beautiful place."

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Yeah.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000
So your, your five/ten year plan kind of revolves around

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
your books. You want to travel. "I want to make a movie." Oh.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Stardust to be made made into a movie or a TV show.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000
As an idea that can complement it. How's that? I would just be to

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
have been on the screen.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Stephen King style. I grew up loving Stephen King. "Really." Yeah, like

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000
when I was, like, in third grade, I was, like Firestarter.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
I want to be cool like that

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000
and, yeah, so, I mean,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
he's a big role model.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000
To me. "Actually I had a question. Why

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:33.000
did you choose sociology as...?

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Let's stay with sociology before I forget.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.000
What made you choose sociology? "Well, I went to community

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000
college first and

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:49.000
associates in humanities and social science. I was, like, pretty broad and I

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.000
had a knack for psycholo. You know, I was really into, like,

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.000
me helping my friends and family through their, like, struggles and

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:06.000
whatnot. And then, I wanted to

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000
pursue creative writing.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000
But we say I didn't really know how to articulate that,

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000
that.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000
And see, the college advisors at the time, I just thought that I'd 

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.000
major and a philosophy minor.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Oh, but philosophy, you can, like, you know, name some lines of others. Whatever.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Well, first semester's at this new school

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000
were smack in the face with that and I ended up

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000
taking, like,

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000
a class by

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
one of the, like, leading professors of that department, and even though

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000
she hadn't met with me and she was like, I don't think

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000
you're meant to be a lit major. I think you should be a sociology

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000
major. And I'm like, Huh? And, like, I didn't even

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000
consider or contemplate sociology and then I,

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000
one of my,

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000
one of my good friends was dating this guy at the time,

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
who was a sociology major, and we were just talking, and I'm like,

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Whoa.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000
I think, you know, being so into the lived

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000
experience, the way that I was then and am now, I just thought

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
it was, like, the right path for me to take, and I'm glad that I took it.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
It's really cool.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.000
You also mentioned you're a hopeless romantic. "Not so much

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
anymore." Not so much? That's my next question. "Oh, go for it."

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000
You, you mentioned this relationship or this

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000
kind of. "It wasn't a relationship. It was just..." OK. "a bad fling."

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000
A bad friend. 

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000
So how do you, how do you kind of, how do you see

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
relationships now?

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Well, I mean. "Both romantic and just friendship?"  Well, friendship-wise, I'm more

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000
selective. More selective and less defensive.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Though

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000
there are some habits and quirks that I have to,

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.000
that I kind of still have to work through but I'm not even sweating it, in the

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000
friendship department. I

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.000
think it's just part of the growing up process to figure people out in that way.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:38.000
I'm always meeting new people, and I love ones that I have in my life,

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:42.000
whether I see them once every few years

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
or more frequently.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000
I'm twenty-eight years old and got into first

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
relationship.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:58.000
So that was a perk. It's pretty fresh. It started in November

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
and so far, so good.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.000
And I'm glad to explore that. "I'm happy for you." Thank you.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000
So it's pretty cool.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
What are some final words of advice for, you know, people

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
on the, well people on the, in the disability spectrum?

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Or even just people who may not identify with

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:38.000
that? "Wow. This is gonna get me thinking." It's a little loaded.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Just,

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000
just

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.000
release yourself from being bound by

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.000
certain conditions or

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.000
things that hold you back. Don't let anything or anyone hold you back.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000
That is my word of advice to folks. Do not let anything or

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000
anyone hold you back because,

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.000
you know, when you, when you follow your own lead

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.000
and stand your ground, you can, you can just

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000
like, you can have a lot of

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:28.000
awesome things arise without you expecting

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000
it. And that's the whole meaning behind life in the first place.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Well, Ash.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Faith, thank you so much for sharing your story with

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
New York Public Library Oral History

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Visible Lives is an oral history project in The New York Public Library. My name is Monica Diaz, and

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.000
I'm just very thankful that you shared your story.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Thank you for letting me share it.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:07.000
(laughing)

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000
When I got out of the hospital, libraries were my

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000
sanctuary. Both local libraries and

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Manhattan libraries. I'm in Queens, so

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000
unfortunately, there's no NYPL in the hood. But, like,

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000
but you know, both the Queen's library and New York

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Public Library were

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000
amazing resources to expand my consciousness

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000
away from being bound by this horrible

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000
damage that some doctors

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:54.000
felt that I was nothing

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:59.000
more than at the time. And I'm telling you

00:57:59.000 --> 00:57:59.000
guys

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.000
for anyone recovering with any disability, Go to the

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000
library. And there's visual

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:13.000
disabilities, there's audiobooks out there. My buddy

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Ashok Rajamani just did an audio-

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:22.000
recording for his book, The Day My Brain Exploded. Everyone should check it out because it's an 

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000
amazing memoir about surviving

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000
your brain exploding and

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:38.000
that's more TBI-related. Yeah but I'm telling you don't

00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.000
I'm just a firm believer in not

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000
letting a disability

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:49.000
bind you. And definitely

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.000
use that disability as an anchor to co-exist.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.000
That's good advice. The library is also my sanctuary.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:05.000
The library's also my sanctuary. "Cool." I think, it's

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:08.000
underutilized sometimes. "Totally. Yeah."

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:12.000
I'm actually, I was just talking to my

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.000
potential career paths in the future for

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.000
being a librarian. "Wow. Your mother's interested. Are you?"

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Because I've loved libraries since the first

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000
memories in life is learning how to read and loving it.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Yeah, and I was always in libraries when I was a kid

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:45.000
like, after everything is said and done and written, to just, like,

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.000
go for library studies of some kind.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000
At the Anti-Violence Project, when I was volunteering there more actively, I

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:02.000
was rearranging their library and, like, developing a system

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
for it. "Nice. Nice." So, cool.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Well, your story will be shared with, you know, within the

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.000
public library archives. It will be available to the public eye. I

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
am certain that everyone will be as awed as me by listening to your

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:22.000
story.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
So thank you so much. "Thank you." For sharing, again. 

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Honor the

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
process.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000
That's my ultimate advice to everyone. 

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Honoring the process is a

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
motto that's helped me get to where I am

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
You did fine. "Thanks."
