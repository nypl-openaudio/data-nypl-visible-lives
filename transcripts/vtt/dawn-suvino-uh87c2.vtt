Hello, my name is ?Lynn ?Lastname out and I'm going to be having a conversation with Dawn Suvino

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
for visible lives an oral history project at the New York Public Library.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Today is December 2nd, 2014 .

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and this is being recorded at the Andrew Heiskell library.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
%um

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Tell me something about growing up -- Sure -- where you come from.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Sure. %um So I was born in Plainfield, New Jersey

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which is about 28 miles west of New York City.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Uh, most New Jerseyites - or New Jerseyans - say that there are two

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
parts of Jersey north and south. %Um. But Some %uh

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
%uh, some folks will argue there's something called Central

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Jersey but usually those are people that don't come from New Jersey. Um, so

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
North Jersey where I grew up, uhm, when I was first, when I was 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
born, uhm, we lived, actually uh, in Playfields in a

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
little apartment my mother and father and my first - our first - dog, Bijoux (?), a little

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
poodle, who I swear I remember my mother always said I only remember it from

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
pictures because I was so little, I couldn't possibly remember the dog.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But, %um, af-, you know, after a while we moved to a bigger house in a town called

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Middlesex -- this is all around the same sort of part of New Jersey, sort of Union

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
County, Somerset County. And then for a little while

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
after that we lived there till I was about 2 1/2 or 3 'cause my, my

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
brother Steven was born at that time. -- When was this, when were you born? -- I was born in 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
March, 1962. And my brother was born in November of

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
1964. We moved in with my mother's

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
mother for a little while while we were... while my parents were searching for a

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
house where, %um, and a town where they really wanted to

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
settle. And that was in North Plainfield New Jersey, where I

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
lived for I'd say, really a year, we lived with my grandmother

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and my mother's uncle. %um And -- 'cause I went to

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
kindergarten in North Plainfield, New Jersey. But then after that we

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
moved to a town called Watchum, New Jersey which is an Indian word as many

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
names of towns in New Jersey are, %um, and Watchung you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
may remember if you're at all familiar with Orson Welles' War of the Worlds

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
broadcast that was where the Martians landed.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
[laughter] the Watchung Mountains. And there really are mountains. They're small mountains.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
mountains but it's a very mountainous area

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and I - we lived there from the time I was six

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
1968 through - till I was about

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
13 I think I finished 7th grade in Watchum

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and then we moved to, back to North Plainfield which

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
where I 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I grew up the rest of my junior high school, high school, and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
even after I went off to college, my family lived there until, um

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
1989 they moved to Florida. I had two

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
brothers, Stephen who as I mentioned before was born in 1964 and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
T.J. Thomas Joseph who was born in 1971. So he was

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
my little baby brother, and some of my fondest memories

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
growing up when he was... my parents were divorced when I was

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
twelve...TJ was about two, um and my mum had to go back to

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
work um to support the family um and 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
so I would pick TJ up from daycare which back in those days it was just really

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
our neighbor who ran a little daycare in her house next door.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So on my way home from school I pick him up and then I had a little baby seat on the back of my

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
bicycle and I used to ride him all... And all I think about it now I can't imagine how unsafe that was

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I mean it was just like a baby seat you know? With a little strap and nobody

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
wore helmets or anything. But you know I would ride him over the place and you

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
know it was it was great to have a little baby brother like that I used to cook for

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
him and you know I'd hold him on my hip while I-- he loved to eat fried egg sandwiches so I

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
used to make him fried egg sandwiches and I'd bathe him and watch

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Bozo the Clown in Magic Garden with him in the afternoons after school.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It's funny to me to think that he's forty three now. Look you know

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I haven't seen him [Yeah.] in a very long time. I'm-- completely estranged

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
from my brother Stephen who clearly has made a

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
significant effort to distance

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
himself from the rest of the family no one seems to know why, but

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
no one can find him. family did... I have a cousin who ran

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
into him in Florida, so he is still living in the same area but

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
you know we started talking some trash when Tommy my cousin Tommy and we

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
went over to him and said, hey, where you been your sisters like to talk to you and he started

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
steamin starting with some we had a falling out after my mother died we disagreed as I

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
think unfortunately families often do about different it wasn't anything to do with

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
are estate such as it was there really was no estate it was just a house

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
but we had some issues about the way her care

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
went towards the end of her life and in any case.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
He. Started taking up that same nonsense again and Tommy just said you know that

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
somebody's going to argue with you you should call your sister what do you know

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
youngest brother T.J. has had a lot of issues with

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
drug addiction and he's been in and out of jail and in fact

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
just finished five years in prison. Actual prison which was

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
an unbelievable nightmare. But.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
You know I stuck by him he had burned every bridge he ever had I stuck by him

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
as best I could until they finally burned my bridge to just about a month

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
ago I haven't talked to him since. That's unfortunate and I suddenly

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
realize my little baby brother and I still worry about him but you know at some point you know

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I had to say I can't keep you know I was just constantly sending him money and

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
he had one story after another and eventually I just realized because I

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
was talking my father about it because T.J. would text my father and asked for my first

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
require me to ask for money then he text my father asked for money and it was one story or

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
another and I finally said you know what this this is just a story is this you know is me

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
making this stuff up and I you know I can't just keep supporting them and I told them so

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
much I said you know you need to.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
All those years in prison and I send money and I helped you out and I wrote

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
letters and sent you pictures and what you clothes and you know all

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
of that and when you got out you said oh I'm going to pay you back and all I said

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
was the only thing to pay me back is just stand on your own and be on your

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
own and stay clean and sober and keep you know working and I'm

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
. The kind of relationship did you know where we were

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I mean like I said he was you know nine years younger than me so

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
we were I mean Stephen and I were very very close by my brother Stephen is two

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
years younger than me until we got into those weird teenage years

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
when he first I don't want him hanging around and then by the time I was like eighteen

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
nineteen and I wanted to hang with him again he was sixteen seventeen eighteen one. We hang around.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
But T.J. it was always my little brother and they when I

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
first came here to New York into college you know I remember having

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
him out for a weekend to stay with me. You know he you know

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I I think I went out on the bus and got him and brought him back and

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
you know we he stayed with me and went to a party at the door you know with me and

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
they were he was like nine years old it was great to show off my little baby brother you know.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So we were very very close but you know I mean he was the

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
youngest son in a family.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Where I think my mother felt very guilty

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
about the fact that he had a totally different upbringing

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
than Steve and like my parents were married and frankly were happily

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
married. My mother always said to the first you know twelve years of her marriage

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
we're very happy. It was just the last couple of years where things went bad and then ended

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
. But. You know and we had money we

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
were upwardly mobile but we lived. What is a very nice

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
you know Tony type town good schools I was

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
part of why my mother chose it. Very progressive schools beautiful

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
homes we had a gorgeous big ranch house on a nice lot

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and one of them was a stay at home mom I mean and she loved that role

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
. She you know she'll be coming to her house every day

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and she cleaned every you know every day. She cleaned the house once a week she quit she did the

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
floors once a week she did. There were like I think there were twenty four windows and that she did in the

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
windows once a week you know she had a woman come in to help her but you know my mother enjoyed her

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
her house too much baked she. You know she was

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
P.T.A. mom you know she went on all the trips everybody she was the cool mom everybody liked

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
you know so that's the other really interesting thing about my mother for me was you know

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
especially after the divorce you know I really saw her as such a

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
strong. You know single woman and this

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
of course you know was at a time when feminism was really.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
On you know exploding it right. So my parents divorced in the late one

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
nine hundred seventy four. I think the first issue of Ms

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Magazine came out of seventy two seventy three on it I would have

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
been right around the time and Marlo Thomas free to be you and me and you know this was this

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
was a wonderful time to be on television

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
what was in it for me was having an abortion I mean I don't think you could do that

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
day on television have a main character decide to have an abortion you know because

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
of an unwanted pregnancy

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
. You know.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So I saw my mom as somebody who was you know even though she had

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
made the choice to be a stay at home mom and then when

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
. When she couldn't keep that

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
choice because she divorced and my father I mean I've reconciled with him since

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
but you know he was kind of a deadbeat dad he didn't you know support us at all he took

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
off we didn't even know where he was for a really long time. But

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
she had to go back to work and she had to take care of us and she did it you

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
know and she just made the change so. You know

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and she didn't she went back to her maiden name that was unheard of. You

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
know she went back to her maiden name and she didn't ask for

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
alimony. She also she has for which child support. You know the judge asked her

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
in her divorce proceedings because my father contested the divorce lawyers

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and the judge is finally Well you know one album that I

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
wanted my name and one is money. I just wanted to take care of his kids you know.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
What's. Kind of especially interesting to me too is that I also

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
had my mother we had one brother and he was twelve

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
years older than than her and his wife

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
letter to Helen was. The most amazing

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
role model to me. Like like I just started my mother's brother and Helen

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
were. Like something. There were something like really sophisticated and cool about

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
them. Like when you go to their house like she always had she always

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
had.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
A Coca-Cola like real Coca-Cola not shop or a trade and going

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
away you know. So so Coca-Cola for us and she had a Pepperidge Farm pizza

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
flavored goldfish which I thought was such an exotic snack you know

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Bridgewater New Jersey. Which.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
You know it's pretty much same basic part of New Jersey. About

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
half an hour thirty minutes from where we lived by color and they had a nice big

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
split level house. I love that house and they were very popular in the sixty's and seventy's

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
I think. Later when Helen would sell it because they divorced too often she she had a hard time

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
because they were not those houses were not popular anymore but I really I really dug that

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
house. People don't like houses with stairs you know my mom chose the house we didn't want

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
to have with it was a ranch house. I haven't you know and it was a very pretty house

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
. So on one level with a couple of places where there was one step up

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
into the kitchen from the dining room and there were there was a mud

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
room from the back porch and that had three little steps to go up to where

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
the bedrooms were all along slightly different levels but

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
I always liked you know houses that had an upstairs and a downstairs and

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
a basement and a yard I mean it's I think one of the hardest things moving in New

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
York is just the lack of space that you have you know how do you work.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Yes You know we had in Washington we had a big backyard and

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
like woods and oh. In North

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Plainfield We also had a pretty big backyard but there were those

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
houses where they weren't quite rowhouses but they were right next to each

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
other you know kind of houses with a hedge or whatever in between

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
but what did you enjoy doing when you were by bike. My bike I love to

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
ride my bicycle I mean obviously this was before I lost my sight on

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
but I really I mean I just constantly was riding my bicycle

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
especially in water because of all that the gorgeous on

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
it was still a very not quite rural but it was

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
. Sort of a suburb it you know it once stood. There were

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
parts of the town. Now it's been built up much much more with developments and all but there were

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
lots of woods and it was easy to ride from

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
walked into the farm country. You know Jersey

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
get such a bad rap from New Yorkers and it's just you know I'm over it because

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
New Jersey was a great place to grow up and you got the benefits of living so close to New York

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I mean my mom and I used to come into New York all the time when I was a kid.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
We saw especially over the summer as we used to see placemat

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
knees all the time and I saw the original production of Pippin

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Chicago of A Chorus Line of you know so many things

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
. And. All. But yet we

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
still lived in a part of the country where you know you could ride your bicycle for

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
hours and stop and Myra feel the butterflies you know

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
or catch you know were catch little frogs you know when you're in a

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
time that you know I can remember like stumbling

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
across like apple orchards just riding my bike through the you know there was horse

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
country out there you know they could stop and just watch horses running and it was really

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
wonderful. So I'd love to ride my bicycle and go on even

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
after I lost my sight which I was fifteen when I lost my sight.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
My mom when you're bored. What the tandem bike so my brother

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Stephen I used to ride a tandem all over the place. We even

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
went one summer we went to Long Branch for a long time.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Yet for a couple of weeks a friend of my mom's had bought a really nice old kind of hotel

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
. So I mean yeah yeah and we went to the Jersey

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Shore for the summers but it wasn't Long Beach Island now that I'm

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
thinking of it but in any case it was a joke. A beautiful Jersey Shore down and

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
like like with us you know and I remember Steve and I

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
rode the whole length of the island back and forth on that bike just

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
as you know as a great time you know.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I've tried out a few years ago.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
I tried to ride a tandem and I think there is something wrong with the bio

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
at least of my ex-wife and I both we rent we had found a place where we could rent

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
one and they brought it down to Chelsea Piers and we were writing it and

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
I mean I think that was we don't think there was just something wrong with the bank it didn't seem

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
stable and we can actually fall but I can

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
feel it. Like we were going to fall. So that was the last time I tried and

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
you know what. I've had issues with balance and you know

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
orientation and things like that ever since losing my sight on because I

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
was bisexual or even illness I had meningitis when I was a

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
teenager and it was a very very bad form of meningitis

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
. Actually up to cockle meningitis which is a

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
bizarre thing for a healthy fifteen year old to get

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
because they they've got that's when they really didn't see cases of

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
cryptic meningitis in the developed world.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
They eventually started seeing it in people with AIDS like significant

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
numbers of people with AIDS having Cryptical committed this they were going to get a garden

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
. Not only so apparently airborne and that

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
there are people who people can breathe it in.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
It's carried by pigeons so you know if if you've been around and then

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
I can't tell you how many times doctors came into my hospital room to say where you live around

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
pigeons you know when I was in a teaching hospital and so was like residents and I was like

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000
no one knew where he was even before they come in you know soon as they walk in I didn't know I was not around

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000
significant numbers of pigeons you know.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
But but the fact is because it's an opportunistic infection you know

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000
healthy people should be able to fend it off. Now the thing

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
is I had a terrible cold. It was

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
September like October or November of one thousand nine hundred seventy

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
six. Maybe even December right. And I just I

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
had this cold and it was hanging around and it was it just didn't want to

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000
go away. And

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
eventually. It did go away

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
. But then a few months later like

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
. After my fifteenth birthday and orders. I start having just terrible

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
headaches really bad eggs and my mom took

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
me to different doctors. You know

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
they thought maybe they were stress related. On.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Headaches. It was kind of a stressing kid you know. How did

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
she get her in you know whatever. So they

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
thought maybe it was monotone with a teacher you know the end but everything they tested for

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
nothing. They couldn't figure it out. Any event I mean

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
eventually I was just so sick. I mean I was insanely sick I

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
mean I couldn't lift my head off the pillow without

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
vomiting. You know I couldn't I couldn't eat anything. Like I just

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
couldn't you know couldn't take pills and I would just regurgitate

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
. And. You know I don't think

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
it went on super long but I don't really have a

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
clear timeline. And you know I

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
guess I could ask my aunt my Aunt Helen about it but I was going to say pretty much any anybody

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
who went through it with me is either dead or I'm

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
not really in touch with them anymore but I do know that. I

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
but I don't I think it was May of one hundred seventy seven when I went into the

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
hospital. My mother took me to a neurologist. She took me

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
to the emergency room and she just said This kid is really sick you have to do

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
something for her and they gave me like a

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
shot of morphine or something really strong and they said Take

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
this neurologist in the morning. And all so I went to the neurologist

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
. They didn't gene. And this is very hazy in my

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
memory because I was so so sick. I mean my mother and uncle who

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
were living with my mother and her uncle. You don't have to like

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
what Carol must carry me out to the core and then as soon as I sat in a car

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
just fell asleep. You know I would just fall asleep constantly because I was in so much

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
pain. That's what your body does right it just says go to sleep now because you're

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
in pain you know. So they'd rather just do what they did

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
the E.G. they said. There was something wrong in my brain

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
. But they didn't know why and they were going to admit me to the hospital. And they

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
waited they could not admit me until Monday that was like a Thursday

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.000
. And I don't know why they waited.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
It had something to do with the hospital and what my mom wanted me to go on

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
to at the time it was Oswald Raritan Valley Hospital that was affiliated

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
with workers medical school. Which is a good choice because you know you

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
want to be at a teaching hospital all if you carry. On.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
And the hospital the other hospital and playfield Newlander hospital which

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
is where I was born and my mother was born and you know everybody I know was born

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
on you know there's nothing wrong with a hospital just wasn't as nice you

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
know. So anyway.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
I was sort of sick and all through that week and I was terribly sick

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
and when I woke up and at that point my vision was kind of blurry

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
but I just assume I mean I just felt like it was because I was I wasn't eating I was

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
delirious sleeping constantly I felt like I was constantly in

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
this state of semi weakness you know.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
So when I woke up one morning and was going to go to the hospital and I went to

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
get out of bed. And I couldn't move the left side of my body

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
I just couldn't move it at all and so I yelled to my mom

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
. And she and my uncle Steffi came and helped me get into the

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
restroom. We just thought it was just too weak you

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
know. But I could not move any part of the left side of my body so

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
they clearly ended up calling me you know the I'm an ambulance to take me to the hospital

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
and over the course of the next four or five days my

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
system just started to shut down. By Tuesday Monday

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
or Tuesday Tuesday I guess I couldn't move any part of my body at all

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
. I was also Mike so I was disappearing. In a

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
totally strange way it was as if someone was pulling the shade or

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
a window shade down from top to bottom on my my eyes and I could

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
only see out of the bottom half of my eyes and then eventually I couldn't and that would get

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000
blurry and then I could and then I couldn't see any more at all. I

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
also why my lung collapsed and they put me on a respirator

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
. And on. I went into. A coma

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
pretty much. I think it was not any kind of deep coma because I do

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
have. Sort of semi.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Surrealistic recollections of things that happened during the time that I was

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
out. But. It was like things would be

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
happening but I didn't know exactly what they were so I would make up

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
. Like. Fantasies around what was really happening for example I was

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
running fevers of like one hundred eighty degrees on and I

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
guess the nurses would come. And you know give me a spare us or

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
whatever you know just you know and I have in my sort of

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
bizarre semi comatose state I imagined that I was

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
like in a sarcophagus that was like a red clay sarcophagus

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
that would grow on me. Little by little it start to suffocate me

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
. And then these angels would come and show me they would have like a

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
plain like a you know like a you know a plane a plane a door with and they

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
would shave the clay off of me little by little and I would feel some relief

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
and it was only after I had woken up and realized what was happening that

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.000
that was the fantasy there was another time they were doing some surgery on my right

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000
lung. And. I remember hearing the doctors talking

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
but not really putting together like what was going on and thinking

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
I was being experimented on.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
I thought being a good Catholic girl I thought I don't I didn't go to hell you know.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
And I am going to let you know. But of course when you're fifteen you think well what every you

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
know you lied to your mother or you you know you smoke too much pot or you do this or

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
that so that's why you're in hell you know where you stop going to church you know because like I stopped going to

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
church when I was like thirteen.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
But when I woke up which was quite quite a bit of time

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
later on and I I said all right now to my mother I couldn't talk

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
because of the respirator but I said how long I've been here and she said

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
you know eight weeks so I was pretty much out for just about two months

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
. Old and empathizing.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
So. And you know people say to me

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
all the time wow that must have been such an you know hard thing to wake up and you know because

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I was blind I was paralyzed I was on a respirator so I couldn't talk

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
on. I couldn't move couldn't you know what I could do was think it here you know

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000
anybody mouthing words was it took people time to figure because you know had said

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
paralysis that my face was dropping you know. But

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
you know I swear to God The thing you think when you wake up and I've talked to other people

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
at car accidents things like you know think oh shit on blind you know we're on our allies

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
. You just think I'm alive thank God I'm alive you know a

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
leader Right This Minute starts to sink in and you realize you

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
know that you're stuck with this and that's that's difficult but but

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
don't you know and. I. Somehow the way I remember it.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000
My mother was there and Helen was there and you

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
know and maybe even my uncle Gus but it

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
probably was only my mother you know maybe maybe not I mean you know because I was in

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
intensive care during that time so they probably were all there very often I don't

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
when I mean my mother was an appeasing when I was in hospital for eight

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
months and the whole time. I mean after I became a waiter writing

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
me if I woke up and she was working she would stop and I was on her

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
way to work to see me she would spend her lunch hour with me and

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
all the day and she'd stop back at the hospital before going home after work

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
and she'd go home and make my brothers their dinner and then

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
she'd come back and spend you know that sometimes my brothers would come. Usually I would come see him and not

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
so much. He was I was fifteen he was later teens.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
But T.J. was five so he came all the time.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
And all that and she was relieved our evening with me you know every day and

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
I don't I don't know how she did it.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
You know did you talk with her or your brother's afterwards about what this

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.000
means.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
You know not so much I thought of my family is a

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
very in many ways very close but there wasn't a lot

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000
of. Talking about. Feelings and emotions at

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
one point. In the ninety's. I probe

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
. A little bit tongue in cheek I wrote my last will and testament

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
because I was such a great place in my life and I was so happy and you know

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
again being Catholic or being raised Catholic

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
I was like oh shit

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
. Something terrible is going to happen to me because I'm just.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
It was going to grade my career was great I mean I wasn't really in a

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
relationship but you know I felt like no one was coming you

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
know I had been in a relationship that and sort of

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
you know happily in the late eighty's early ninety's so by the

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
ninety's I was just you know sort of out over it and happy and Anyway

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
so I noticed last will and testament and I you know I told my mother and

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
my brothers especially you know a huge part of that I commented

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
to certain people things that I thought about them and you know I told my brothers how

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
sorry I was if you don't ever. They felt that you know I

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
and I know they must have felt that I got more attention and

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.000
more.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
All there was you know given to me.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Because of my disability you know more attention more.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Your people went out of their way to make sure. You know I got.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
The things they thought I needed or should. All and I'm sure there were times when

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
my brothers felt that they were neglected. In

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
fact during that time I was in the hospital at one point in the summer. Late summer

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
was like August my mom told me that she was going to take the boys to the sure for a

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
week. But that she had arranged you know I had lots of friends that would come to the hospital and my

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
uncle stepped on in such a hell and all these people would come and go you know

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
so I was never going to be alone and I remember really feeling resentful and even at the time

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
thinking you know you jerk I could have been resentful she said you know she spends all her

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000
time with Hero and neglect your brothers and yet you know

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
you're resenting the fact that she's going to go away for a week but I think that's something.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
I've struggled with all of my life is the sort of feeling of abandonment and

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
I'm sure it comes from you know my parents' divorce I was I

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
loved my father very much not that I didn't love my mother but you know I

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
was the first born. I was. The only girl

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
. And I mean my daddy and I were so so close I used to

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
you know used to drive. Around to whatever you know whatever instead and then run going to the

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
barbershop doing this and that and I would I would sit right you know on the front seat right next

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
to him and he had a convertible which was fun and he always let me play

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
my Wizard of Oz eight track you know and that was great and he carefully played my

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Wizard of Oz you know over and over again. Well one of the most amazing things he did for

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
me was turn me on to Frank Sinatra from a very young age so I always love a Sinatra

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
and I was because my dad is listening to Frank Sinatra in the car. So when he when

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
my parents split up and my father pretty much disappeared

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
right on. I believe my mother you know I blame my

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
mother for it. I mean I think that's probably a really common thing.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
But I also think that I was I remember or with my

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
mother at one point and I'm going to go live with daddy and Norm person go ahead. You

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
know. But I agree even at the time thinking that he doesn't want me to come up with him

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
you know you know where he was at the time the front or at first when they first had

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000
separated Yes he was still living in the area. But you know

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
he that's how we got back in touch with him he had left I would say. So they

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
split up right around one hundred seventy four seventy five.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
And. Probably around seventy five and then he

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
took off by seventy six he was gone we didn't know where he was

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
. But I and then I got sick

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
. In seventy seven.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
And he called my mother. And said that he wanted to come see

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
me.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
But that he was afraid she would have him arrested for you know lack of support.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
And she of course being the amazing independent strong woman that she

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
was just said No I think it's more important because your daughter I'm not going to. Do anything to

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
hurt you know to go after you or anything so I guess it turned out that you know we had friends

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
that still lived in the area and somebody had called him and said you know your daughters really really sick.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
So then I said you know I got back in touch with him he came up to visit me

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
you know. And. You know and I and I when I was eighteen I

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000
went he was living in Florida he still lives in Florida. You know I went down to visit him

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
. And it was just great to have this renewed

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
relationship with my father and I kept that relationship probably from the

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
time I was eighteen fifteen sixteen until I

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
was.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Maybe twenty two twenty three mid twenty's.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Even I guess a little later. And then I. Hear

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
. Two things happened really that made me stop. Responding

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
to him because he would call and I would either. Scream the call you know through

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000
the old answering machines order. And not take the call or he'd write

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
send me a birthday card or something and I just ignore it.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
But the two things that happened one I started to really think

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
about. What he had done to us that he had just

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
left us you know that he just didn't. You know.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Think. Like you know my feminist nature came up I started thinking he

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
just you know I have these children and then left you know we just left us

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
to be raised by my mother all by herself and

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
didn't you know.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Didn't make it easy restitution you know or or whatever and

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
I and I. Sort of fell. Out of respect for my mother you know

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
screw Viendo who's hita if I can.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Get my attention or my love and affection.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000
That was. The. Version of the story I told

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
myself. Mostly. I think the reality was that

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
by nine hundred twenty S. was when I really

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
realized that I was a lesbian. And I began to

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
act. On you know on the fact that I was a lesbian but I

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
was still sleeping with men you know at first I think this is very common

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.000
bisexual I get by not being you know pinned down by labels or whatever but

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
even in my mid twenty's I knew I could you know I was not attracted to

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
men. And I was only attracted to women. And

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
somehow. I didn't know how to tell my father.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
That. Now the great irony is

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
. That my father remarried when he was in his

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
late forty's so around one thousand eighty seven so around the same time

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
. That I was you know realizing what was going on in my life

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
and he you know Gayle his wife had two small children

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
from a previous marriage and raise those children. You know like I

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
said I've recently gotten back in touch with my father in that scene and I feel very close to him and our

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
kids are great as his stepchildren are great and I'm glad to have a family

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
a step brother to step sister and brother in law and sister in law but you know

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
my father's sister in law Gail sister was a lesbian and

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
they just love I mean they love that she's passed away unfortunately she did get sick

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
ovarian cancers. But some. So my

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
father was totally would have been totally fine with it and at some point after

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
my mother died my mother died in two thousand and two on

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
. My brothers kind of got back in touch with my me my father kind of got back in

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
touch with all of us and because my brothers were living in Florida they lived on the west

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
coast of Florida My father lives in a Fort Lauderdale East Coast area they went

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
to see him on like Thanksgiving and stuff. After my mom passed and

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
I guess Billy told him I was a lesbian and he called

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
me and he did and at that moment I was living with Elizabeth

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
. My my ex-wife who you know I got together with we got together in January

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
two thousand and one and so you know my mom died in two thousand and

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
two so in October two thousand and two so you know it was probably you know

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000
around the time December of two thousand and two when my dad called me and

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000
what exactly remember how he said it but he basically

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
said something without saying the word lens of the Union or Gary

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
or he just basically said you know it's it's fine with me I really would like to see you and read a

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
little bit you know. I was the same thing though when I told my mother. Right so

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
. So my first really significant relationship with a

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
woman was with a woman named Jackie and it started in one thousand nine

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
hundred eighty seven. And we lived together from eighty

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
seven through eighty eight and we actually moved to Philadelphia together

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
because.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
I was going to go to graduate school at University of Pennsylvania was going to be a Ph

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
D. there. So on we moved to

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Philadelphia in July of one thousand nine hundred seventy you know Tip Don't ever

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
move to Philadelphia in the middle of the summer it's you know I did so.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
It's with the rivers it's just unbearable. Black In any case

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
. So. Everyone there are you know from eighty seven

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
eighty nine and when the relationship sort of ended

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
in eighty nine and I moved back to New York shortly thereafter but

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
during that time in one thousand eighty eight my mother's uncle who Michael Steffi was mentioned

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
several times we lived with him you know we moved in with him when my parents divorced and

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
. He was you know really it was really like a father figure to me even

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
though he was much older because he was my mother's uncle and he was like a father figure to

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:48.000
her too because her parents divorced when she was six months old but I mean he

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.000
might misstep he died in one thousand nine hundred eight October of eighty eight. So on

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
We he and Jack you know invited my mom and Stephen and T.J. down to

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Philly.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
For on.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Thanksgiving and me and she is a chef actually went to the Philadelphia

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
restaurants.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
And and I mean we had you know this big beautiful apartment because it's Philadelphia

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
and you can afford it but of course you know there was one bedroom and one bed and you know

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
it I mean. So I you know. I don't know how

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
I deluded myself into thinking that somehow my mother didn't know I was a lesbian right

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
. But I remember when I moved back to New York in eighty nine

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
. And it's funny it was right around Thanksgiving time that this happened. I

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
moved back in the summer of eighty nine. But. So I am one of the

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
things I wanted to do was get connected with the community. Right because I was in school

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
anymore. Right I didn't mean people I didn't just you know lovers or partners

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
but I mean the people you know you meet them through school or through work and I was

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000
working on went freelance and poured time and so I I started

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
a lot of different groups at the Gay and Lesbian Center which was like a cell

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
G.B.T. center.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Q X Y Z.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
No alphabet so but I joined what was then called gay and lesbian

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
independent Democrats has a different name now I can remember of it. I started

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
volunteering for the lesbian switchboard which while that seems like

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
such an archaic thing now that people would actually sat in his little room and people would

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
call and ask a question and he would have to look in a book to give the

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
information you know about things you know and

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
that's you know not you know not even twenty one twenty

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Twenty some odd years about less than twenty five when you were talking about

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
it you know you were trying to write for me

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000
.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
I had a little laptop buy an old laptop with business

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000
vision and so I put the most common things in like a Word

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Perfect file on my laptop and then I had like some other

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
general numbers that they could call if I didn't have the really specific

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
information.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
So that's how I did it.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
And also in the very beginning they actually And then they did this to everyone when you first

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.000
start you go through kind of a probationary period and you work with somebody

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
else so there was another person there and they were all obviously sighted

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
So they could look in the book for me. But a lot of the course

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
information course they were. Not quick crisis calls but just

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
sad and lonely people calling. So you just kind of talk to people you know

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
. Or gave advice you know. On. Peer

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000
counseling kind of stuff. But but anyway so I was doing

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.000
all this stuff and. I was thinking you know I really want to tell my

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
mother that lets me and I have gone to a workshop and identity

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
house on internalized homophobia. And

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
really was really enlightening because I was thinking about that I thought you know

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000
all your friends know you're a lesbian anyplace you ever work or go to

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
school. You're complete you know you're out. And that's so funny

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
because I was just saying to somebody today you know out what does that even mean

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
anymore like. Like is anybody in the same way closeted anymore I mean I

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
guess that's all filtered through the perspective of New York so

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:49.000
but but anyway for my mother this long letter telling

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
her about you know that I'm a lesbian and I first realized this when

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
really when I was in college even though if I look back I knew it I knew it when I

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
was a teenager but you know I didn't know what it was exactly and

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
. And that I wanted to be honest with her and tell her about you know all

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000
these groups I was joining and how it was so great to be connected to a community

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000
and that you know Jackie had and she didn't Jackie because we were together two years you know so I mean my

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
mom knew Jackie really well right. So. You

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
know I see you know the jacket was really the first significant relationship by it handed

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000
you know that I wanted to be open and honest and I remember what I was living on Bleecker and

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Thompson I was looking out onto the streets between Bleecker and House to it and I

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
remember walking over to the mailbox. I think it was I think it was on the corner of

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Bleecker. And I dropped that letter in the mailbox

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000
I remember panicking thinking what if everything I know

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000
to be true about this woman isn't true what if somehow she too has to

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
include believing you know somehow I'm not a lesbian. I mean you

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
know and what if you know she doesn't she stopped loving me. You know I

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
don't think that you know but. That was

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
what was underlying all of it right. What if. What if she hates me now because I

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000
think you know people of a certain e is that that's what we were afraid of

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000
him coming out. What if people don't like us anymore you know. And

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000
especially family you know that's you know people that this was the height of the AIDS crisis

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
people were. Being disowned by their families you know

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
. And it was. Like the

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Monday before Thanksgiving that I that they sent a letter.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
And on. The phone rings. When that Wednesday morning

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
and some and this again free you know free caller ID or anything. And

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
somehow I knew it was my mother I just you know it was a ring

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000
And I picked it up I said hello. And my mother said Dawn. And

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
I said Hi mom. And she said Listen honey I got your

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000
letter.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
And. I know you're a lawyer. I

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000
am. And I you

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
know if this makes you feel better to have you know written this letter I'm really

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
glad that you know and you know and I'm so glad that you've been in these

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
joining these groups.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Sounds very interesting. You know and I mean it was just amazing you

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:40.000
know and. You know now I think about I think how could I you know

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
I never thought that you know she didn't know where that anybody didn't know

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
you know it's so I don't know but but so that

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000
was a big piece of what made me. Stop talking my father for a long time

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
too. It's amazing how much. That.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
That kind of. Fear. Because with

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
disability with your disability there are some people that you know don't

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
don't like you because you're disabled. Blind. Which

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
by the way for the record you know I fortunately took recover everything

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
other than my eyesight and I have balance issues on which

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000
probably has to do with having been paralyzed but eventually I did get

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
back on my feet started with being able to when the right time and then kick my

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
foot my friends would come and say let's see that kick with knife

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
and then you know after I left the hospital and I had physical therapy and

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000
everything is possible but then for they I went to a rehab center for about

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:54.000
a week but I pleaded please not have to stay in that rehab I promised I'd

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000
come every day after school and I did January of ninety seventy eight I

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000
rejoined my class at north point of high school and

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000
graduated in one thousand nine hundred time with my class.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000
But three hundred seventy eight every day after school I went to children's specialist

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000
hospital and now inside New Jersey and got physical therapy and occupational therapy so that

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
eventually I was able to to walk in you know one

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000
which I really run is on the beach like I love to run on the beach because you know.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000
That's about it you could just sort of run in the surf sometimes but other than

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
that I do. Where.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Do you. React to

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:42.000
that

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
. Well you can mix with your friends I mean that was really interesting so

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:51.000
. My best friend at the time I had two best friends ones a woman named Kelly

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000
McCann or what I actually saw a woman younger I mean we were told fifteen were

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.000
teenagers. And my best friend my

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000
best best friend was a guy named Michael Scott Sara and Michael

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Remained a really good friend through all. Of

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:11.000
.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:16.000
It. Eventually we had a little falling out but that was not related to the

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000
blindness so much. Everything's related to the blindness in one way or another I'm convinced

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.000
of that. It's just like you can't say you know it has nothing to do with being a woman.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Everything has something to do with being a woman on. And I think a blindness

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.000
especially but on I so. I hung out

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.000
with a crowd of girls that. You know smoked in the

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:45.000
bathroom and cut classes and.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
You know were.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000
You don't run around their hands with boys and drink and Bob

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Right because once was I happen to be really smart and so I was like an

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000
accelerated classes and stuff like that but I was still one of the mean girls

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000
you know. Well most of those

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:11.000
girls. Really didn't handle. The blindness very

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:16.000
well. And I ended up getting. New friends.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:21.000
MICHAEL Like I said stay friends. I hoped so. Besides kind of the cool

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000
girls. I had also these other friends who were more

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000
like smart girls but not cool girls so in the future worlds and high school right

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:35.000
. Well it was kind of great because I got to

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000
. Be popular and be smart and you know be on the newspaper and

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:45.000
you know do all kinds of cool stuff but. But so will

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.000
the other girls the smarter girls the girls and whatever they do. They

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000
stuck around and I and I got to know more of them but we really ended up

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
happening. When I went back to school. In seventy

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
eight September of seventy eight or so I

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.000
started making friends with upperclassmen because they could handle it.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.000
That right I was a sophomore at that time because I was a freshman and when I got

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:19.000
sick. But the experience that changed me and

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.000
really. I think. Was very significant

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:27.000
I was in.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
College. And must have been the fall of seventy

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000
eight. On. My girl.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000
And my friend Dana who have been just someone I adored I had a big crush on her own. So

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
right on I don't think I really realized I had a crush on her she was she was the

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000
older sister of my friend Leslie and Dana was like the class

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000
. Actress You know she was like and you know musical plays and

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.000
she used to come to the hospital and sing to me she had a wonderful powerful young woman's voice

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000
on. But anyway Michael Dana and I were going to go

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:09.000
see a benefit concert at Douglas College which is part of

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Rutgers University and it was a benefit for Bill Bradley and we really wanted

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.000
to go because they're not ready for prime time players we're going to be there in the Chevy

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:23.000
Chase and Gilda Radner and Lucy and so on. Paul

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Simon was also there which was cool. Melissa Manchester what I liked very

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:33.000
much right now. I think what you know and go on

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000
and a group called the Patti Smith Group which I've never heard of.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.000
So we get to the concert incident like this auditorium. And you know

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000
the bleachers and then everybody smoked everywhere and like we were smoking cigarettes

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:53.000
and I mean Michael Tina did the song and all these young college kids were coming around

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000
with you know as tracing put that out you can't smoke at the other tour you know whatever it

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:03.000
was very docile crowd I remember I was wearing blue carpenter genes human

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:08.000
genes they have like a little hope on the side of your leg where you can hang

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000
out our cars I have those on and a little pink sort of terry

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.000
cloth you know almost like a golf shirt type of a thing.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
The very sort of preppy preppy and sneakers probably

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000
.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000
And.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000
So we're not ready for prime time players. Some little sting curtain and Gilda

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Radner and I was fine. But the

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000
crowd and I went down to the stage they have these barricades up so nobody could get

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.000
close to the stage but the crowd was like this. Sort of more

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000
menacing kind of crowd and it didn't seem like they were college

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000
students mostly I mean we were sitting way up like in the bleachers so we were away from the

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000
people on the floor that seemed like they were.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000
You know just like troublemakers in a way. So

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.000
. You know it's her nose. Manchester came out sang a little bit by the time

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Paul Simon came out. And he was singing something like Bridge Over Troubled Water and he was

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:15.000
singing a huge hit The crowd was chilling.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Me. Me me.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Then they just basically bowed Paul Simon off the stage and he just stopped

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:27.000
singing with this guitar he said Ladies and gentlemen the Patti Smith Group and Patti came

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:32.000
out. And in microphone she spend a lot of people down in

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:37.000
front and from nothing on the stage and the audience on the ground just

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:42.000
totally ripped out all the barriers and just got up to the state and she

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.000
started singing the song called privilege set free. And the

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.000
opening lines or something like I see it all before me. Days of days of

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.000
love and torment nights of rock and roll but I can't remember because I

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000
. Want to old remember song lyrics

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000
. So what it was she was singing about she had apparently earlier that

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.000
year she had fallen off the stage tripped on. A cord.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000
And flew off the stage and broke her neck and she had been you know wearing a neck

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.000
brace and so the tour was that the previous year was called an

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000
attraction back in action and I guess the drummer G.D. dourly had

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:28.000
written this song for Patti and it was about.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000
You know what it's like or at least to me what it was like

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000
to get sick or hurt and.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Your life changed. Right.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000
And. I was just I was mesmerized and couldn't

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:50.000
believe what I was hearing. And I mean that experience

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000
. It turned me from a sort of a potential preppy to a

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:59.000
punk in a matter of moments moments.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.000
I immediately you know went out and bought Patti Smith

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:09.000
albums. I started reading her poetry and one day Michael and I

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000
shared a locker in high school and one day he was getting something out of the locker and I don't know

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000
about in your high school like art school people always hung up pictures inside their or their locker you

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:23.000
know and he was going something and I had these pictures of Patty

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.000
.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:29.000
In the locker and this woman Julie was walking much at all like

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:34.000
your picture as you pointed out with me. And Michael said that stones

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.000
which Emp and Jenny because there are you know pays for this from

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:43.000
New Jersey anyway and there were just party girls all over Jersey high schools at this

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:48.000
time and she said that one thing is a patty thing because I was

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000
still kind of dressing like a little preppy you know because what I know I didn't know

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000
. Punks were dress I mean punk was still pretty new you know in seventy eight

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000
. I mean I guess it started around seventy five

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.000
forty five do you.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Not in England because people like to pretend is an American

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000
just like most musical genre but it has to go to England to get sort of.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:22.000
You can verify it or whatever and then the stupid Americans decide that they like it but anyway

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:25.000
punk was a New York thing. So

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000
. Cheney and I were in a class together

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:34.000
. I can't remember what it was an elective class because she was a year or they were she and her

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000
friend me where you're ahead of me.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:42.000
And all but I mean when I started hanging out like crazy and B. and her

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.000
friends and and then she took me shopping we can remember we

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.000
came into work and we went to like a bunch of thrift

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:56.000
stores and Army Navy stores and you know I got a

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
bunch of punky clothes you know she was the one who is used to doing with

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000
it exactly exactly and then I started getting a sense of it myself to you

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:06.000
now.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
But the funny thing I mean it has to be so how was my relationship with Fred so so I thought I was just

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
like being friends with all these upper classman.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
And Michael I don't mind it and then but then they would

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
graduate and I was like Taylor graduated two years before me and I had

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
one from rich who I was friends with to they only he wanted to I think even to move

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
before that. On me or what would go off to college and you know even though we

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
would write a little bit you know it wasn't the same. So then I will make friends with people

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
who are you know if I was a junior I would make friends with people who are seniors but then they put me

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000
graduate so. So eventually

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:56.000
by senior year. I was sort of

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000
forced to go back to the girls who you know I hate to say it

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000
ended me because I don't think that's really what happened I just

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:10.000
think. For the most part most of them weren't really

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:15.000
. Able to sort of deal with this big change I mean we

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
were all driving right. They all had boyfriends they

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
all. You know I had jobs

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
. After school jobs. You know and I think it was hard for them

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.000
you know I didn't work I didn't drive I didn't have a boyfriend. You

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000
know I was there for you. Well it was OK because I you know I had my

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:45.000
for my upperclassman friends you know. On. So

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
when I when I when senior year came along it first will seem new year for me and

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I know a lot of people had really shitty experiences in high school I did a lot of my

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
high school I love my teachers I love my classes on.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
You know I loved high school on I was popular. I was more popular after I was

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
born because I was the only black kid you know. There actually were two other

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
. Girls who were legally blind. But. I have one

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000
of mine you know pretty well what the other one is a good friend also a good friend of Michael's. But

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I didn't know her till we all three. Michael and she and I walking

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
to N.Y.U. for college so I got to know her better

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
. And after college and actually she was the first

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
woman I ever kissed that's what I say or name because I don't know where it.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Was a very distinctive but I don't know where she is.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
I've been married I've no idea. But they

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.000
. But you know so I started you know hanging back with my old

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
girls you know. So I still hang out with that angel all day and moved here to New York the

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
year you know they graduated the year before me but I would come out to see them in New York or if they were

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:04.000
home in North Plainfield I'd see them but you know there was a huge punk movement. I mean

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
there were so many punks on that I just started being friends with

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.000
lots and lots of new people who were punks you know. There was a

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000
whole group of guys that I was really friendly with who were you

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000
know punks. And

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
. So you know and then with the senior year was really quite

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
magical I mean everybody was kind of friends with everybody. All that bullshit about

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
clique's And this nature seemed to really melt away and people you found

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000
yourself hanging with people that you had never really hung with before you

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
know you you know you know you'd be sitting on a bench in the

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000
you know in the back of the school and somebody else that you didn't really know was there and he just started

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000
talking or because you were you were growing up ready or getting ready to go off to

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
college and to be independent people you know

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
. So. You know there were I mean there

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
were some dark days right from the time. Being in

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
the hospital and being so so sick and then

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.000
. Going back to school. You know

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:25.000
it I mean I was I mean when I realized that I wasn't ever

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
going to see again. For. Weeks I lay in that

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
hospital bed and I would just. Hysterically all day every

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
day and just wrote separately because I couldn't

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000
you know find a garbage pail because you know even I mean I couldn't you know I wasn't mobile enough

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000
to get to one so I would just weep and. Blow my nose and throat

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.000
. Because the you know the thing is the whole time I

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
was in the hospital.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
You know I kept getting better right first I couldn't move I couldn't talk and I couldn't

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:05.000
breathe on my own and I couldn't eat I had an easel gastric tube which is how they fed me you

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
know and then little by little they took me off the respirator and I could and then when that the hole in

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000
my throat started to heal I was able to you know talk again you know in a very speedy voice

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000
but you know eventually I could talk and when the power as the paralysis started to go away

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
even then before I could talk people could read my lips easier because you know a lot I didn't

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000
have the paralysis and I started building my feet and kick in and then walking

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
with a walker and then you know I would actually just walk in

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000
. So I just thought well of course I'm going to be able to see you know and I

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000
guess nobody. Thought to tell me no that's not going to

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
happen. You know I mean my optic nerves were crushed by the swelling in my

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:53.000
brain. Right. I mean absolutely one hundred percent

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:58.000
totally crushed. Arm. And you know I mean

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.000
yeah maybe nowadays if if we ever get with the program and really start you know investing in

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
stem cell research maybe they could regenerate optic nerves but

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
you know that I think that's going to down the line past certainly

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
past my prime you know even if I'm eighty I don't know that I'd go for surgery

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.000
at that point my life you know. I've probably I don't know but

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
anyway but I remember the social worker

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000
.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Talking to me in the hospital. And I said something about. Well I'm

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:38.000
just going to get out. I'm going to get surgery and you know I have my eyes you know I'll

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000
just get eye transplants. And she said I don't think

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000
. They can do that. And I said What are you talking about. They do it all the time and

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:52.000
she said but that's not a part of your ONLY that's you have been affected

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:57.000
. And on. And that's that's when I first

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.000
realized that my eyesight was not coming back

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000
And that that was really really depressing really depressing.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
But you know again you know a fifteen year old kid is pretty resilient.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.000
And you know I and I think I am I think Mido once Rick

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000
No I'm very reserved yet you know and I just said screw it you

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
know I'll just go on but I remember one week in my head

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
thinking if I'm not if I can see by the time I graduate high school I'll just kill

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
myself.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:39.000
But I never really.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:44.000
You know that was like my little plan. But I never really thought I would

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
do it you know.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000
But some point if there are I mean what kind of help did you get to go back to

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000
school or OK So well in school.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Yes So what they did was. You know well my

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
because I got sick in May right. Oh I done well enough in

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
all my classes that they passed me from freshman year only

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
one class ironically typing decided she was going to pass and you can be an incomplete

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000
whatever it didn't I knew how to type spotty really care because I had learned to type before I

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.000
even took that class and we took the class because it's going to be easy to pass it on because of my mother an

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I.B.M. Selectric at home and I learned to type on that anyway

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
so I was really the sickest. In May June and July. Right.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
So why organist I was pretty I was you know pretty much getting better

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000
. So the school started sending.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Tutors in September. On my French. They sent a French tutor

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:54.000
teacher you know an english. Teacher.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I don't remember if they sent a math teacher I feel like there were three

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
teachers. And I remember the two the

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
French or the English. But I don't remember if there was a third

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
and it's kind of curious that it was French and not like history but now

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000
.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:21.000
But anyway so I don't know and maybe they did other work with me like maybe I think it was like to

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
get in on this with fear that through to my favorite high school English teachers

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:31.000
either one of those I don't win again and came to my house as a tutor

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
later but anyway.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000
You don't like history work with me too you know they say they were there to read to me and they asked me questions and

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:44.000
like only answers and things so that they did but what they also

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
did was with Montel. You know

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000
they set up like a walkie talkie type system. At my school

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
and in my hospital room so that. They would just carry

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000
this device from class to class wherever it was going to the next

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000
class I could bring in and then I would listen in to my

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
classes that way or it was really great. Maybe that's the only reason they sent the

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000
English or the French because those were the two I think they did send a math teacher or maybe I just

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
didn't take mass that first semester because I remember pretty

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
clearly from my high school they had two trucks college prep and

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:32.000
and what they call business and if you were in college prep all of you

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
definitely take four years of English four years of.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Health I think you have to take four years two years maybe three of history

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
you had to take at least two years of you know two math

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:50.000
classes. Maybe three.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000
And on and then a bunch of different electives and a language you had to take language

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:00.000
so well. So I'm pretty sure they did send a math tutor.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000
So anyway but some of the students of my classes and then you know

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I would blame the teachers that came you know in the afternoons would I guess give me the

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.000
assignments. There's a lot of pressure over every one of my own.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000
English classes classes like we see so funny that we get like a spelling test in a

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000
vocabulary test and in sophomore year but I guess we did and I

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000
remember I will make do with a test over the you know for one thing

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000
but you know luckily I got one hundred percent every time so you know I mean

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000
you know I feel embarrassed you know. But

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000
. I knew it wasn't meant to be a mean thing like because I remember saying you've got

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.000
it right in front because you've got a mind like a steel trap. It's amazing you know.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
But then so that's why I think I was able to go back to school in January you know

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000
when I got out of the hospital I went right back after the Christmas break on

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000
there was a little push back to school I was nervous about

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
having a totally blind student. I was connected with the New

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Jersey commission for the blind. And they were great about it they just

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000
said no this is her choice she wants to come back to school. We will help you will

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000
help put together with and you know it without really too much

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
pushback and it was a little bit but the school just said OK. And how do we do

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
this you know and they got the woman she was an older woman and

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
she's probably forty and I was sixteen.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
But another woman who had worked with blind since I guess she was probably a T.V. Ali

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:48.000
and she helped with you know like like for my geometry

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000
class and all she helped make little manipulable stuff like

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Fiola and. And then we had just like a student teacher who

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000
was like for starters I would have like study hall periods you know I would go into.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
You know they are much like those in the library and

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
all. We were just you know she would read me my silence that I would dictate you know my

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:17.000
answers this is all pre computers people there was

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
. No computers I guess they were but not you know

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000
that is seventy eight seventy nine. Not really you know I think he left the

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
library got computers that year I graduate in ninety eight

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
. But anyway and I was not a

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Braille reader. I. Tried at first I resisted

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
completely I didn't want to read that shit.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
You know that's my attitude towards it was you know I read visually I don't want to read

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000
that you know but my my commission councillor was actually

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000
really clever and she said well we could we could bring all these Patti Smith poems you

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
know.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000
It was really cool of her because though they were kind of risk you know they were a little dirty some of them and

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000
there was some language you know but I guess you could have my mother in my Or if I was reading them then you

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
know it was fine.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.000
So I just you know because of the paralysis and the residual

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000
neuropathy I just was never able to really pick it up and subsequent to

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.000
that I've tried several times to learn to read Braille and I've just not had any

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:29.000
luck. I had a little bit of luck in the ninety's I was really dedicated to it

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
and I was doing all right but. You know and I actually you know I

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000
memorized the code on Grade one Grade two I I

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.000
did learn but then after a while I because I didn't read it I you know lost that

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.000
but. So I was able you know back in the day to use a breadman

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000
speak to write in Braille. So that really reinforced

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I'm learning the code but it was just never going to be an efficient way for me

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
to actually read. So everything you know I did was always

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
either on tape. Or. On. You know I don't

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
. You know I would go. Dictate and someone else would

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
transcribe.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:21.000
All I remember even so there's another student I remember in senior English class there

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
was an essay I don't want this kid Jared either Mr finished early or

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000
he wasn't taking the test that day because I remember the teacher saying Jerry will you go talk to the librarian

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:35.000
just write her essay and you know we did it and

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:40.000
. It was about Brave New World I remember very clearly because I remember using the word quasi

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000
religious and it was like a good back in the day when when I school

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:47.000
students seniors knew how to write you know.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000
But. So that you know.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:58.000
I forget what you want is how the school dealt with it and more. So yeah I mean and they

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:03.000
even formed a little community of five a great

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:08.000
committee or five or four committee and I was on it and a woman who had

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000
a developmentally delayed son and another guy. Who

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:18.000
I guess he was a parent and he was he used a wheelchair and we would have little meetings

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.000
about how the school could be more and the principal the assistant principal and

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000
talk about how the school could be more accessible and better it was.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000
It's amazing I you know I've reconnected with so many people I went to high school with now

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:37.000
on Facebook and on and I did go to my twenty year class

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.000
reunion back in two thousand I did not go

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
to the thirty year one I wish I had.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
There were circumstances that made it impossible for me to go on. But

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:56.000
I axed some of the women that you know I went to school with have

01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:00.000
said to me Don I. Have used you as an

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.000
inspiration to you know my kids when my kids would I have one

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:09.000
friend whose daughter is very very very sick when she was in seventh grade with

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:15.000
I don't know if it's congestive like cystic fibrosis or so

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:20.000
she just retains fluids in her lungs and gets very very sick and

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:25.000
this friend of mine said you know I told my daughter about you and how you are an example of someone who

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
could really perseverant that she could do it too

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
. And and you know look for most of us we don't like to hear that you know we feel like oh that's

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.000
just you know. I'll smoke or whatever but.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.000
If you know in a way. I feel like if I was able to

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:46.000
give people. Something that they could use in

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.000
raising their kids to. Talk about you know how you

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.000
. You know you personally are and you and you work through hard

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:01.000
times because you know. No matter how you want to cut it you're getting

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
that sick and being you know at fifteen and having to deal with that

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:10.000
that is a hard time having now right my blindness is you know something I'm

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.000
comfortable with I'm not happy about it you know I wish I didn't you know

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.000
happen in some ways in some ways I also see it as a

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:26.000
real and incredibly invaluable experience because. I

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:26.000
think.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000
What I always think about being blind and I don't know exactly how to

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000
articulate it but I've said to people that until you experience

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000
it. You really have no clue what it is. Like it's

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.000
not what I would have thought. Being blind would be. You know I don't know

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000
what I thought. I guess you know the experience of putting a blindfold

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:57.000
on. Because I remember we did that in like eighth graders

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000
something put blindfolds on had people walk us around like it was a

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000
class activity that we did. For some reason.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:12.000
And feeling scared in this world and all the things that a sighted person who just

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.000
suddenly became blindfolded would feel.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Pain. And I guess you know that's what you'd think of that's what

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:25.000
we're always told sighted people think when they look at us they think oh my god how did how

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
do you. How do you get up and walk across the room and how do you.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:32.000
Because they think about well if I put a blindfold on that I would be scared and

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000
disoriented and fears and they you know think about the fact that we've learned you know

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
techniques and you know we've been trained or figure things out on our own

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000
. So. But

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:52.000
you know I think. It's. I don't

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000
you know. Even though I'm totally blind and really have.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000
No light perception like I think I have light perception because when I turn on

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
the light I think I should see the light but I recently had left a

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:12.000
job earlier this year and I opened a case with the New York state commission for

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
the Blind in order to go through the entrepreneurship program start my own business

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:21.000
. So of course I guess it was the commission has sent me to an

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000
eye doctor you know to verify that I'm blind.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
And I mean he was shining the light usually coming when you see the light and you know he said

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
that. Would be like.

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
Now you know like I thought you said you had life.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
It's not a good idea I guess I don't you know but

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
but it's a much more you know dynamic world then

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
I think sighted people imagine it to me you know

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.000
And that makes sense of course because right it's you know it's not again not that your other senses

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.000
become heightened answers that you tune into them more or you use them

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:06.000
you know or you you real you know you hear oh you're just made more aware

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:11.000
. Of. Things but then you know especially if you've had a vision I

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:15.000
can't speak to what it must be like if you haven't had vision but if

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
I know that. I think.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:22.000
I have a visual imagery in my head at all times you know and

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
what's interesting about it for me is that it's. A

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000
visual. Like it's not a realistic visual perception. Or

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
perspective. I guess it's not as if. I

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.000
only picture you and the things on the table at

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
my hands which are on the table.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.000
It's like I sort of picture everything in this three hundred sixty including

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.000
myself you know and I think it's your time you know to be able to

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
see myself so. So in a sense it's almost a richer

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:01.000
visual. World. Then. Than

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000
actual vision. So I don't know I mean

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:11.000
not really because. You know I think a visual memories I think of how

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
stunning.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Vision is. You know something. To be.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Real. I.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000
Mean I have just memories of things like like walking home from school.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
And then walking up the driveway and we had a dogwood tree at the side of the

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
house and just looking at the dog wood in the grass it was a spring day and the blue

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
sky and just picture perfect days and just just how pretty

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
everything was you know.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
And things like that and you know.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000
So I you know of course. I know that a real you know visual

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:55.000
perception is you know stunningly intense

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.000
in a way that Mommy. Made up. Or imagined. Right.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Perception is not.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.000
What it is and the interesting thing there too is that I sort of dampen it because the

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.000
perception I don't picture it as vividly as I would

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000
if I were trying to conjure like an image of. What this

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000
must actually look like. Right. Like I sort of put a little

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000
grayish. Black and white kind of tone over it because.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.000
I think somewhere it might. Be OK.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.000
So we break you know like SR does not equate you know

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000
real or whatever you know it's. So when did you come to New York

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
City. I came to New York in one thousand nine hundred eighty eight

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000
for college I knew I wanted to go I always knew I wanted to live in New York as I

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
said I wrote twenty eight miles west of New York.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.000
We used to come in here all the time especially during senior year we could see Lou Reed concerts

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:06.000
and Paddy concerts and G.B. and you don't remember

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:10.000
ninety days of the legal drinking age was eighteen and we were all eighteen you know

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.000
. So I always knew him from the time I was a little girl but I like

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:20.000
to live in New York. So. I do.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.000
What I want to apply to Columbia and more you know what it

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:30.000
was like the only two schools I know even know what their high school was in New York

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.000
City right. But. Somehow I didn't end up applying to

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.000
Columbia I only applied to N.Y.U. I applied for early admissions. I think

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:44.000
it was because my mother was like no you shouldn't live downtown.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:49.000
Blah blah blah you know. Because the village at that time was really a

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:54.000
totally different place it was much more much more. I

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
mean I remember going to parties.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000
In you know at every party every D. and fourteenth

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Street and we went in a group of like eight people there

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.000
was no way you could go. Over to Alphabet City. Of

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
by yourself.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
I remember being at parties and people showing up and having a mug with you know

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:21.000
broken skin you know like my friend Michael Board and I were

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000
held and knifepoint by a train Z. And you

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.000
know Kansas fried chicken on fourteenth Street and Second Avenue mind

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000
you. Yeah. And nobody helped people walk in and see what was going

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000
on and just walk right out.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000
But eventually Michael got the knife away from him and. Threw it over the counter.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Call the cops. And we got to leave. But

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:53.000
. But yes I applied for early admissions

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000
on me.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
And I got accepted and.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:02.000
So that's where I knew I was coming and my mom came in and we we decided over the

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
summer we drive in and try to meet with like I'm really just I was going to register for

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
you not pick the classes I wanted and we would come in and meet with whatever

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:16.000
professors we couldn't see if we could get the syllabi and dorm reading

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:20.000
lists and see order from recordings for the blind or what

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.000
. We. Were professors

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.000
I think for classes maybe only three I think the first semester I took only

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.000
three. Now I think that for I think I dropped one but the first

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
professor there was going to be a change in that Professor because

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:45.000
there was a big scandal he was called Dr quit looting was an anthropology professor and he was

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
making clear limits at N.Y.U. and he got fired. So the

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.000
woman that was going to be teaching the class was like anthropology You know one of those surveyed

01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:00.000
classes. She was like on a date in believes or something

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:05.000
you know and. Couldn't you know she they she hadn't made it her syllabus yet.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.000
So the syllabus that the other guy even you know I thought

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.000
she would probably use the same texts. So we ordered

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000
whatever books we could and those we couldn't we bought.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And my mom and her friends recorded them for me so that when I started for

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000
school I would be able to I would have all my books. And

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000
unfortunately it turned out that. That anthropology

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
class the woman I mean was Linda Bass be a Associate

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Professor but she didn't she used one of the four

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000
texts she used one or two but then she was using to others

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:52.000
. And I was scrambling to get somebody to record them but it was

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.000
and she was really good this professor. She was so willing to work with me. She was like you know

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:02.000
maybe I can we can do it like a modified almost independent study and I can work with you

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000
want the other books that you recorded.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000
I mean it was really you know in some ways I feel like I've had this charmed life I mean

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000
this of course in the in the context of the fact that

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:20.000
I mean I don't want my life I wanted to be a filmmaker I wanted to I

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
love movies I like

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000
. That's how I met my friend Michael Cera. That's how you know I first got to

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000
really be friends we just both loved movies. He actually is a

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
filmmaker and a film critic now but you know I wanted to do the same thing I

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000
wanted to write movies and to write them and maybe do some acting.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000
So when I lost my sight Of course I. I just thought well I'll just write you know I

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000
love writing I'll be I'll be a journalist or all be right or you know

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.000
. So that's what I planned to do at it. Go.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000
On.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.000
And I took. The first journalism course I took went really well and the professor was

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000
very nice and helpful. But and even the

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.000
second one I saw was a woman professor and she was pretty good the

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:16.000
first one it was for something like media in America or something like that or the history

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:21.000
of media and it was really interesting because many people don't realize is how much

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:26.000
crime journalists and writers and lawyers write were responsible for the

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.000
revolution right the American Revolution so it's all tied up in

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.000
American history. The Stamp Act. They want to.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Put a. Tax on paper you know that was not a smart thing to do is piss off

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000
journalists right. So but anyway.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.000
And then the second was called reporting one o one and I was mostly just

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:53.000
writing and learning and write a story. Third course I took that I

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:58.000
didn't know when media in America is like and that. Was with the. Department

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000
chair arm chair and that man. Was a complete

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:08.000
. Asshole he could not be used to Portman. He. Flat

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:13.000
out told me you cannot be. A journal you cannot be a

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000
reporter because you're blind. Purely. Right and it was

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.000
ninety or ninety one I think it was probably by might or.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Might have been my first freshman year I think was my sophomore year. And on.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.000
And you know I was a kid and what did I know. And there was no way D.N.A. I mean

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
yes that was the Rehab Act.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:39.000
You know. And I was even on the fog of war we have a committee at N.Y.U.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:44.000
. But. I may not have been at that point I might have joined like in

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
my. Junior years.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.000
But I just. I just didn't even think to fight it

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:59.000
wasn't right. I knew he was wrong. I knew what he was saying was false

01:30:59.000 --> 01:30:59.000
.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000
But. I couldn't easily. There was no

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:08.000
technology and wasn't Braille reader. I didn't have the

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
tools.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Never mind the actual logistical tools I didn't have the emotional advocacy tools to

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000
know what how to fight this is the chair of the department. You know

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
if I could remember his name I'd say.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:29.000
You know something I think that I think I remember his name but I

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:34.000
know I don't exactly. So.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:39.000
I gave up the dream of being a journalist I just said. OK. I'll do

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:43.000
something else. And there's something else I chose was

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:48.000
French. And it was because it was I mean I had studied

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.000
French from the time I was in sixth grade through senior year in high school

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:56.000
. And when I got to N.Y.U. intro to French

01:31:56.000 --> 01:32:01.000
was a five day week with a mandatory language lab. And it was six

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000
credits and I thought that's an easy game.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Since I was twelve years old I'm going to take into a French and I did it and

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000
then. I took. You know whatever the next one was and

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:20.000
it was like elementary French an intermediate French and and then my friends Patty and Jenny

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.000
and I went to Pat went to Paris and to the south of France one summer I think it was the

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:29.000
summer of one thousand nine hundred one or a Jew. But when I had taken

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:34.000
more French classes. So that's when I said screw it you know I know you has

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:39.000
so has it and what your broad program the French Department is nice they like

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.000
me and I'll go study French you know because that's the way nineteen year

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:48.000
olds think don't think about your career.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.000
And but you know in the back of my mind I've never

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000
.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000
Healed fully from being told I couldn't be a teacher as I

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
wish I had fought it I wish I had known how to fight it

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:10.000
but then you know. When you're blind when you're home and when you're a lesbian when

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.000
you're you know you're you're fighting all your life and so

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:19.000
. Who you know who wants to fight everything all the time but

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.000
I think that would have been a real fight a real fight and

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I think even just going to do the N.Y.U. broad program was a little bit of a struggle because

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
you know the department was a little freaked out by it.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:37.000
Luckily I had an advocate at home and I do remember her name is Kathy teller ecologies I don't

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:42.000
think she's learned what you anymore but she just she was like this one of those or she just

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:47.000
like you know people are saying maybe she shouldn't go to the and my brother and she just

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
kept like putting in my paperwork and help me.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And she was great and she was just terrific and. You

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000
know and then I did I mean it was that. So yeah I did sort of regret

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.000
not having become a journalist but by the same token I mean. I can't

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
believe I got to live for a year in Paris and all of what that

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.000
meant that I mean my French is way Rusty now and you know I have a

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000
master's degree in French. I wrote my master's thesis in French you know

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000
. I was completely fluent in French but you know that's. One

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.000
thousand nine hundred seventy nine you know really no one is around the last time I was really speaking French

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000
so my French is pretty rusty but.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.000
And what an amazing experience. And. I met some of

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
my dearest friends people I'm still friends with from from the United States as well

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.000
as from you know on other parts of Europe. On what I was at.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:58.000
N.Y.U. and. Paris and you know I did so well that N.Y.U.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:03.000
offered me a fellowship to stay on and do my master's degree. And they

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.000
paid for. You know they paid for my entire solution. And I have a

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
. You know a job at the university and I got paid my you know fellowship

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000
money. On and it was at that point that I really started becoming more interested

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.000
in. I don't linguistics as opposed to just French I was

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:27.000
studying Italian when I was in France. I learned Italian and then I was

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:32.000
auditing in German classes and I got this German teacher while I was here

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
. So.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Back at N.Y.U. and I was applying you know to Ph D.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:43.000
programs and I'm going to sound like you again because when I applied

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:48.000
to Yale I applied to Penn and I applied to N.Y.U. for my Ph

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.000
D. and I have done my research fellowship when I was a

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Master's candidate at N.Y.U. in French at that point I was really

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
starting to be more interested in linguistics then just

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:03.000
language.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:08.000
And. I really was interested in you know the sort of

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:12.000
computer application of linguistics synthetic speech and voice

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.000
recognition and the woman who was the graduate chair at the

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.000
linguistics department. On. Dr who recalled Maida

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.000
she was working on very early speech language and

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:31.000
. Constant battle sequences you know developing synthetic

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000
speech with something called the class synthesizer which was invented by Dennis glad that later became

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.000
the deck talk arm. And I think I asked the

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Department of French department if I could do my fellowship. Work in the

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:51.000
department listings and they said yes that wouldn't be a problem. I did I think I

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:56.000
did one half of the research fellowship in French Department and the other half it was

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Dick's and.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.000
So I didn't really frankly want to stay you don't want you for my Ph D. I

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.000
wanted to go to an Ivy League school and I wanted to leave and well

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000
you know even though I loved it you know after a certain point you're like I need to get a degree from a

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000
different school because it's too incestuous. It's you know it

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.000
but I did apply when I applied to Yale and Penn I also applied to everyone you know

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:28.000
because. It was like my backup plan and why he was

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:32.000
not going to reject me because you know I had successfully done my

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
bachelor's and master's degree there and I had worked with the linguistics

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.000
department on a successful fellowship and. So on.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000
But of course reared its ugly head again and then the guy who was the

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.000
chair of the department I can't remember his name anymore either so you have blocked out the ones that were really

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000
horrible. He was not.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:01.000
He was not. Wanting me to be in his department and I remember I

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:05.000
was in his office for the one of the most tense

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:10.000
meetings. You know. And at one point it was long it

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:15.000
was two three hours long. And at one point I just said something because I was smarter

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:20.000
at that point right I was twenty six or twenty seven. We

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.000
still were a few years away from the day but I said.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.000
You were not saying to me Dr whatever that you don't want me in your

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:35.000
department because I'm blind or you know. And he said no I'm not saying that I said

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.000
good so I'll expect my letter of acceptance you.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Know and I did get accepted and of course but I also got accepted

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000
and I was much happier to go there. Oh University of Pennsylvania at a

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
much. You know what I thought was a much better mystics are not that that was

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.000
not their enemies was bad but you know William noble

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.000
giant of. Linguistics is I was the chair of

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.000
the department. And he said when I worked under for my research fellowships that a

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:14.000
couple of years I was there and on. Every front and frankly

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
to Noam Chomsky has degrees from

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:23.000
. Penn is Ph D. in linguistics even though most people

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000
associate him with an oddity or Harvard but he studied under so

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:33.000
I actually had some of the same professors. They were very very old.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:38.000
I did I had some of the tops of these professors when I was at and I

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:41.000
toured I toured that program and.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:49.000
Almost anything. Up until my recent divorce actually

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:54.000
the only regret I had. Deep regret I had in life

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:58.000
was that I did not finish my Ph D. in physics that I walked away

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.000
from a full fellowship. Here. And

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:08.000
. But you know then I would have been a college professor which is what I

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000
sort of wish I was but a part and then again going back to

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:18.000
that story that I tell myself. Right. I did it because

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:23.000
I saw people graduating with Ph D.'s from you know what was

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.000
arguably the best sociolinguistics department in the world. And they were

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:33.000
lucky to get jobs and you know cancers and I want to come back to New York I

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000
was I was in a relationship that it ended it ended very badly.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.000
She was cheating on me. I I was you know it was horrible I've also been

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:48.000
betrayed and I just wanted to come back to New York I didn't

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.000
. Actually at first I fled to Berkeley. I decided on. Or

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.000
put California for a summer. But I mean like if there was two

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:03.000
. As as as Mike Michael Cera came with me to help me sort of get situated

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
he said there's way too much modulus and that's what he

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:12.000
said to me I think I'm the only man I've seen in a necktie in the

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.000
area but it just wasn't for me I mean they were very nice and I I think and

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:22.000
I think they had a whole sort of west coast school of linguistics out at Stanford and

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Berkeley and all but it just wasn't for me it wasn't for me the lifestyle or

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000
whatever and I want for New York every time I've ever lived anywhere

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:36.000
but is now just heating this town these days. I you know I

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.000
always want to come back to New York I can't imagine. Where else I

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:42.000
could live you know.

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:49.000
When you talked about influences in your life like the influence

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.000
of the feminist movement and. I'm wondering

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:58.000
how that played out. In the experiences you

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:03.000
had experiences with how people reacted to your

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.000
disability and the things that didn't work out because of that. Yeah

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:15.000
Well I think you know it's about that that you with a passion. It's interesting you

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:20.000
know. I mean I was. I

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:25.000
feel like I was born. A fence. Or porch. Or that's my water

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.000
bottle going to be a feminist just the time growing up

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.000
at the time that I did as I mentioned earlier. You know

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.000
Ms Magazine and you know there's a there's a a documentary it

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:44.000
opens this Friday called She's beautiful when she's angry and it's all about

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:49.000
that early you know feminist movement and I can't wait to see it

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.000
because. You know. I did I saw some clips

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:59.000
of it and I was like wow I remember these things I mean I was so young but I remember it.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Only.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Recently. A few years ago a colleague of mine was honored at something

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:11.000
called a New York Women's Agenda. It's a nonprofit you know sort of a consortium

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.000
of non-profit agencies and you're if you're a member

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Agency which the agency I was working for at the time was you could nominate

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.000
you know one of your female employees from the author and so there's all these women that are

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:30.000
. But then there are celebrities that are ordered to and here and I went

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.000
to it and I don't because I really love this colleague but

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I mean I wouldn't normally got breakfast at seven o'clock in the morning you know down in

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Paris you know not. OK.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:49.000
So but Jane Fonda was being honored. She was the

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.000
celebrity being honored and she was she was

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
being introduced and that honor was being presented by Gloria Steinem

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:03.000
and you know I mentioned before I love theater I go to a lot of

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:08.000
theater and calm and I think some theater is just extraordinary

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:08.000
.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:13.000
But it was very rare for me personally to stand up at the

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
end of a show.

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:20.000
It has to be exceptional and that's not only because I think that's a really

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:25.000
special honor and I know people in nowadays people jump up the minute the curtain falls because you know I

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:30.000
mean if you paid three hundred dollars to see a show for what you know you're going to get a

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
standing ovation.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:36.000
But when I when Gloria Steinem came out on that stage I

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:41.000
leapt to my feet and started applauding I just couldn't believe I was

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:45.000
in the same room of course I know my colleague who was sitting behind her all

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.000
said she just she said Jane Fonda looked a little frail and in fact she got she

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:54.000
got really cold at one point and he had to come bring her sweater.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:59.000
But she said Gloria Steinem was like extraordinary cherub like these these really

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:00.000
are.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:05.000
A purple velvet like bell bottom pants and this big red get a

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
belt and you know she was unbelievable. But

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.000
. I mean in a way it's

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.000
really funny that I was so influenced by

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.000
feminism in a way because you know like I said my mom was this

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:28.000
kind of stay at home mom. And even if she was really a strong independent

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.000
woman. You know she wasn't

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:38.000
a super feminist in any way but it was just part of the ethos you

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:43.000
know. Ms Magazine free to be you and me Gloria Steinem the exposé of Playboy

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:44.000
the you know the.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:50.000
I mean you know why don't you be here and one day at a time you

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:55.000
know and Romano a single mom raising her kids and you know

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.000
I was telling you the other day you know I I remember going to sleep over a

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:05.000
girlfriend's house when I was a girl I was like twelve and I was wearing a T.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:10.000
shirt that said I think it's a glorious time code is you know a woman without a

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000
man is like a fish without a bicycle. And on the girl's

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.000
father and brother just laid into me and started arguing

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:24.000
with me and you know and I just there was this twelve year old like totally

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:29.000
standing up for my ferret is believes you know what we're doing that you know equal pay for

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.000
equal work and you know global and it's

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.000
just.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I. Wonder if. Like it was

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.000
part of you know we somehow. Knowing that I was a lesbian

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:51.000
but not really knowing. What you know I

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.000
mean kids then more were much more naive in that way I

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:00.000
mean I think in a way we were more politically savvy than than kids maybe are

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.000
today. But. You know.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Being gay in the seventy's and suburban New Jersey was not something you would

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:17.000
have discussed or wished or wanted to. You know so but I mean certainly by the time I

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:22.000
was in high school I knew it you know I knew I was a lesbian but you know I

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:26.000
didn't really as I mentioned earlier that I was I came to N.Y.U.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000
. And I started seeing people like me you know. But as far as sort of the

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.000
feminism and the disability. I don't know

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000
when I. I feel like being a feminist

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.000
.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Need. It more OK with being a

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:50.000
lesbian and that being blind even though frankly back in

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.000
the day anyone who knows the history of the women's movement knows there was there was a

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:59.000
real push to marginalize lesbians. They didn't

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.000
because the straight women didn't want everybody to think that feminists were

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.000
lesbians officer and so and apparently that is very well

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:13.000
documented in this this. This documentary that was on the net

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:18.000
but in any case I think being blind we were

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:23.000
able to be out as a lesbian because being blind was

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:28.000
something you know I'm totally blind I use a guide dog. I've used to guide dog

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.000
for thirty six years. I'm curious to

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:37.000
know I mean people I mean because.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:41.000
You don't want my. Blindness as a result of optic nerve damage.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000
People are often somewhat confused because you know I don't have anything clearly

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:52.000
strange you know wrong with my eyes or you know and I can look and of course having outside

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:57.000
I can look at people and blah blah blah. But but there is no

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:02.000
mistaking me as a blind person unless you you. Know. So

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:07.000
being completely out and of being able to pass as not blind I

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000
think sort of made it OK for me to be a lesbian too because I was like What the

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:16.000
hell you know it's just one more thing that like you know puts me apart

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:21.000
from the norm and. And being a

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:25.000
feminist being a woman. Feminist woman was just

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000
something I was always proud of. I mean by. By the

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
time.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000
I was thirteen or fourteen and my parents split up and I saw where my life was going

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:42.000
right and we moved from the Tony Hills of Washington down back to

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:47.000
you know North Plains which don't get me wrong I love North Plainfield I love my hometown but it was

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000
you know it's it's not fancy I was all immigrants you know

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Italian remembers what you say to me but she wasn't till she had gone to

01:49:57.000 --> 01:50:02.000
college in Michigan that she realized OK Two thirds of the world is an Italian you know but you

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.000
. Know I knew by the time I was in

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:12.000
early teens I was going to have to. Go to college and get a job and I was

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:17.000
probably before I lost my SO sight I figured I was going to have to work in order to

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.000
go to college because there was nobody I was going to be able to pay for me to go to

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000
college. In fact my brother Stephen did you move to California establish

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.000
residency and work full time he worked from seven in the morning to three in the afternoon. Then he drove

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.000
two hours and went to school from six o'clock in the evening till ten o'clock in the evening you know to get

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000
his college degree. I lucked out I got

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:45.000
my god the commission for the blind to help me so. And I got to

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.000
go to a private college my brother went to a community college. Well you know OK

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.000
California State College not so much music out but

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000
you know. I don't I don't know or

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:06.000
I don't know it's an interesting question that interplay between feminism

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
and disability.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:13.000
And certainly I don't think maybe you need me to have more of

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:17.000
a predilection for. Advocacy although I

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:22.000
don't think of myself as a really. Strong.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Like that. I don't see as my major role in life. As an advocate

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:32.000
. I certainly feel that I'm a champion of.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:37.000
People. Whose rights are often squashed. But that's

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:41.000
not just disabled people. For me that's you know

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:42.000
.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:47.000
Black and brown people and women and Arabs and

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Jews and all kinds of people that in other are being you know women

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:58.000
being you know like getting disenfranchised wherever they are in

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:03.000
the world. But. But you know I mean

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:07.000
and you know curiously I. Have not always necessarily

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:11.000
advocated very strongly for for myself.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:16.000
I have at times. But many times I haven't. So

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000
.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:22.000
I don't know. Do you think you see if your experiences of

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.000
my resume in France or if there was anything different there.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
There was. Possibly a little

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000
more. Of.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000
A. Paternalistic type. We have to take

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000
care of you. But it was not.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:47.000
All for.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.000
In that way. There are organizations

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:56.000
. You know that they you know helped me with

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.000
. There were books I could get even in English you know or recorded

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:05.000
books you know for pleasure of reading their work. There were volunteer

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.000
organizations that help to support me because when you you know

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.000
go there for the end where you program you can take your not only are you

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:19.000
registered with N.Y.U. which has its own facility and you take two classes a

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000
semester at N.Y.U. or in Paris. But you could you are registered with the

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.000
nineteen colleges of the Sorbonne University in Paris. So you could take

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:33.000
courses anywhere and I took. Courses at one of the schools that

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:38.000
really specialized like intellect and linguistics and language

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:39.000
so you know.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:45.000
And it's my god. Paris is not an easy city to navigate I mean it

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.000
was built in seven ninety nine or something like

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:55.000
thirty I don't know what it's been there since you know easily the the eighth century you

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
know.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:00.000
And or ninth century and.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:05.000
There are streets that are just tiny you know and and

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.000
it's like lower Manhattan you know like way lower Manhattan where they just curl around and

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.000
you keep walking and then you're over so you're on a different street and you know you have no idea how that happened

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:21.000
and people just park on the side walk. What I will tell you is the

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:26.000
French tour dogs they out was never an issue

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.000
. Bringing my guide dog anywhere because all dogs went every few

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:35.000
hours in restaurants you know they just

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
adore dogs. So.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:42.000
On. So that was you know. Find

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.000
you know the woman who sort of ran the and where you program you know

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.000
from an administrative standpoint of faculty standpoint was very nice

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:58.000
but she was very worried about me. I think again she was somewhat

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:03.000
older woman and I think she felt I was her responsibility and

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:07.000
at some point. You know when I first went to the

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:12.000
N.Y.U. program even though I was still kind of a punk like I

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:16.000
think I kind of like children down a little for Paris.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:21.000
I kind of went back to you know just Khaki is and

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000
tops and I think I even sometimes wear skirts I think that that was an

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:30.000
experiment I had for a little while I was like right before I left for presents like I'm going to wear skirts

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:36.000
and I put out some scripts for the night. I like just couldn't deal with it I was like I feel like a drag

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000
I cannot do this you know but I have this notion that I was going to do

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:45.000
that I was going to wear skirts pond was over you know even though you

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:50.000
know we all still liked our own music and it was over it was over by nine hundred eighty one eighty

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000
two.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Patti had retired in one thousand nine hundred eighty two and we came back after Frederic husband died

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.000
and she did make more money but I think she did because she's doing great now but

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:06.000
anyway all right. So. But at

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:11.000
some point in the middle of the academic year at N.Y.U. abroad

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:17.000
like I did I went super punk like super punk and

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:21.000
that's when I first started cutting my hair super super super

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.000
short and bleaching it. I mean at that time my hair was. Very

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.000
dark brown and so I would strip it out. White.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:36.000
Platinum Blonde and then that guy this guy had

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:41.000
to my hair in Paris he was amazing he was like an artist and he would shave all kinds of

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:46.000
weird designs and do it and then he'd color them in different colors. There's this

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:50.000
photograph of me in this French journalist Yuri sitting on this

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:55.000
. Bench outside of the foyer where I lived and it's my

01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:00.000
friend Ethan took it from behind and my hair and it just looks like it's like

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
a lightning bolt.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000
In in this blinded you know.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Yes that is then what color didn't read in purple and blue

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:16.000
and I mean it was just extraordinary. It would take it to when I was dedicated man it took

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:21.000
like six hours to get get my hair done and because it was so short I

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
had ever done often.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.000
But some and I started my friend a friend of mine came to visit me on

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:32.000
. Christmas time. There was a Christmas time

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.000
and. That's when I think that's when we first cut my hair that was

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:42.000
. It she just cut it you know and then I found to be a star doing it

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:47.000
for real. But. And then she took me shopping she's like don't you

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:52.000
look you you know you're not you anymore you take shopping get out these corduroys get out you know

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.000
as you want me you know like. Skinny like black jeans and boots and leather

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.000
jacket and blah blah blah. You know gave me a whole new make over

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:07.000
And so I just became a punk again like super punk and that freaked out a

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:12.000
lot of the faculty and people I was dealing with

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:17.000
. So that was kind of hard. And also some of the all

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:21.000
the other volunteers that would have scored me places like they were not cool with it you know

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:27.000
but you know. That was part of being a punk right was the

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:31.000
whole rebellion piece of it. That's rock N roll lifestyle slow

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:37.000
and it was at that point in my life that I was really starting. To

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:41.000
realize. That I was a lesbian and that I was going to be a

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:46.000
lesbian and that nothing was going to make me. Go

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:51.000
back. You know. To not. And

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
. You know what it was after that when I came back from

01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:00.000
Paris in eighty five you know I real I had my first real

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.000
significant relationship with a woman.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:09.000
And then the rest is history. Never entered it never

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:15.000
you know went back. Home. And that until

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:20.000
of course and I know I was in two thousand and one well in two

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.000
thousand the very end of two thousand. And we met

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:29.000
online back when I was dating services were actually free. I'm

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:32.000
amazed that people paid for that now.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:36.000
But yeah it was I think it was a site called Friend Finder.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.000
That's what I'm almost positive it was called but it's if it was it's long gone. Because

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I tried to find it once before. You know. So

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:51.000
and I mean of what I liked especially

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:56.000
about meeting women for whom the services the dating

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:01.000
services online was like you could tell first of all some of them had amazing

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:06.000
algorithms and really matched you very very well. Like they were just you know send you

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.000
a note saying so and so just you know fill out a profile in matching here and you could pick the

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.000
parameters of what was important you age and you could pick age range you could pick whether

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:20.000
they should have a graduate degree you could pick what kind of things they like to do you know.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.000
But what was amazing to me because I had a few. Experience is

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:30.000
where I met someone we talked on the phone it didn't work out or I had a brief

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000
affair or someone that I met online but

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:38.000
. You could like what you I mean for me and Elizabeth

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:43.000
. We would write his own letter. It's like real we

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:48.000
write to each other you know and we did that for weeks and weeks before we met

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000
and we were great clever intelligent you know things and I would

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.000
you know so that was that was an amazing way to get to know whether

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:03.000
you thought somebody would be right for you because you know if I wrote something like

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:08.000
this you would start with just a hello I saw your profile looks like we might have some

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:12.000
things in common and if they were like you know you want to get together and they're like oh.

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.000
I want to know who you are before.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000
You know because there was no you know that the idea of when do you tell that you are

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:27.000
disabled you know and what friend front fighter there actually was

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:32.000
a box you could check off that you were disabled and you could say what you had hearing loss

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:37.000
but it was true and I. And I had seen other sites where you could do that

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:42.000
too and I never did it. I just left a black book with this time I said screw

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:47.000
it I'm doing it because I'm sick of deciding when is an appropriate time

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.000
to tell the person because if they'd send you a picture you know what. I

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:56.000
. Do. I don't want to show anybody your picture and I don't want to tell you that I can't see your

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:01.000
picture. And so you know you wouldn't know what to say you know.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
So.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:08.000
And it was funny with a friend finder you could check the box but it was like really

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:13.000
down it was like so far down on the profile that I thought you know what I've got a lot

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:18.000
of people want to get there you know. Because I knew I would be looking for people's

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:23.000
profiles like after the first few things you know. You're like now

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
we're you know this looks interesting and he stopped reading.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.000
So when I was first writing there was a point at which she had said she

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:35.000
was very active. She was a martial artist and she

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:41.000
was a fencer. No wonder you know so you know

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:46.000
she said that she had twisted her ankle and was having a really

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:51.000
hard time going up and down the subway stairs. And I responded I

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.000
said something like yes all you temporarily able

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:00.000
bodied folks should learn now and again what

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:05.000
. What it's like to be disabled. As she wrote back and she

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:09.000
said I you know I don't know if it was very terse but

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:14.000
put me in my place basically saying I have a disability. She had a traumatic brain

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:19.000
injury because of a car wreck and of course you know that's that's just very

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:24.000
hard disability to live with because it's invisible to most people and you know it's

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:29.000
very hard to understand what it means because it's not the same for

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:34.000
everybody there are you know and and it changes you know how some day he is

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:39.000
you know she would be really sharp and on point and other days she'd be extremely

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:44.000
fatigued or you know were confused. So

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:49.000
. That's when I said well you know and I did go back and I said you

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
know I'm really sorry I mean you know.

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:56.000
I didn't know she had put it in her profile I think I would have seen it yet but

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.000
maybe not. And was funny about her profile because when I was looking through

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:07.000
I was notified that she had logged in you know that she had signed up and I went and looked at her

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:11.000
profile and I thought this looks like a really interesting person but then what are your

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:12.000
hobbies.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.000
All our hobbies were like running skating

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:23.000
in martial arts. This that she was a huge science

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:28.000
fiction fan I was like boy this is just not you know this is not me I'm not in the

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:33.000
active lifestyle gal I like you know sit around a tree you can watch

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:38.000
it you know and so on and I'm

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:42.000
very social but you know that I like to go out for meals and I like to you know.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Clearly I like to talk I'm talking for hours here but so

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000
.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:52.000
But anyway I went a couple days later I went back to her profile and I

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:57.000
just said I got a right to her because something you know and she

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:02.000
later told me that she also had gotten notice of my profile but

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:07.000
it was like before Thanksgiving and her friends in Texas and she was leaving Texas so she

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:12.000
didn't get a chance to write. But but anyway. So we

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:17.000
ended up writing and writing and writing and and then eventually on January twenty second we

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.000
had our first date and we were twenty second two thousand and one.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:25.000
And. It was and I knew from that minute that

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:30.000
this was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with and you know sadly for

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:35.000
me I can still feel that way. You know we've been separated

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:40.000
for a little over a year on it was not my decision to

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:45.000
separate. Although I realize that there were problems in

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.000
the relationship. Of course to first blame myself for all the problems because I think you

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:55.000
know that's. That's what you do when you know when when something goes wrong that you don't want to

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
go wrong.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:02.000
But then. You know what I've come to realize

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:06.000
. Looking back at the thirteen years we were together all

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:11.000
over missed all the problems that existed you know in a

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:16.000
marriage you know that that both people contributed

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
. But.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:24.000
But you know we were we were really really happy for a very long time you know when we

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:29.000
we moved in she she moved into my partner's funny you know met online and I

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:34.000
live on West twenty second Street and she was living on West sixteenth

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Street. So you know we were like six blocks away from each other and never seen

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:44.000
each other. Or. You know run into each other in fact the first

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:48.000
night that I asked her if she wanted to go out of the place I picked to go

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000
for dinner was at the corner of sixteenth Street and Eighth Avenue

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:59.000
and I said Do you know where the Chelsea grill is played is that you've got this smile

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:04.000
because it was on her walk. So. But you

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000
know. That. You know we

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:13.000
. It's hard I mean we were together through nine eleven

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:18.000
through the death of my mother through. You know happy times. Good

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:23.000
job bad job. Loss of her jobs. Death

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:27.000
of two beloved seeing eye dogs. You know we got married

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:32.000
in two thousand and eleven August of two thousand Aug eighth two thousand and

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:37.000
eleven when same sex marriage was legalized. When we got married you

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
know.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:43.000
So you know unfortunately that also meant we ended up having to get divorced which it

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:48.000
is amazingly difficult to get a divorce in a reasonably simple to get

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:52.000
. Married. She filed for

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:57.000
divorce and you know the pause was something

02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:02.000
like you know retrievable breakdown of the relationship and then

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:07.000
you know because she was the one filing she had to like talk to the attorneys and you know and she

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:11.000
didn't want any alimony or any you know she just wanted out

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:16.000
. But. You know she was telling me that they were asking for things

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:20.000
like well you know you can't just have one fight and then you know want to divorce.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:25.000
That's No one. When he could have won women together and we're going to marriage license I

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:30.000
mean there's no it's so easy to get married and it is it

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
took forever to get the divorce

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:37.000
. Isn't that ironic in for me that this was you know it's so easy to get married.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:42.000
Yeah but you know this is it's incredibly easy to just go there you have to go ahead of time the

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:47.000
day before a couple days before to get I don't know what all this shit is about blood tests at all I think

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:51.000
it like this I think there was an old times when V.D. tests you know

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
but.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:59.000
We just you know went to the they call it the marriage center everybody calls it things at

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:04.000
city hall but it's not it's actually them it's called the marriage Center it's a new new facility was

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:07.000
built not so many years ago.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:12.000
And you know you get a number and then you go and you know when your number is

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.000
called you you get.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:18.000
Some files and papers and they give you.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:24.000
It's going to give you something and then you come back. The next day or a couple days later

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
and you bring a witness and you get married

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:31.000
. But song but it's an amazing place because especially in New York

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:36.000
because for one thing this was you know there were there were a lot of like military personnel

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.000
in like four regalia because you know they were going to get married when they when they're home you know

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:47.000
wimmin sloper I don't get you know there were two

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:51.000
women and four bridal gowns you know a lesbian couple there were you know men

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:56.000
in you know in jeans and T. shirts getting married there was you know there were like

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:01.000
folks from other cultures and countries in like you know on you know their sort of

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:06.000
classic you know like African go or to work or you know Middle

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Eastern or so and you know there's been you know lives within our you know we have like

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:15.000
matching T. shirts and look at what other magic T. shirts for

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:20.000
our bridal party and we all were a bunch of kitschy rainbow stuff you know we had

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:25.000
like rainbow bracelets and rings. You know but it's really an amazing place

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:28.000
that that someone should do a documentary about because.

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:33.000
It's it's really quite amazing that that was so it's funny that I was

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:38.000
there a very very happy time I never thought of

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:43.000
getting married. Do you know I mean I was so happy when it started being

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:48.000
legalized all over the country and especially in New York.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
And of course we would get married. I mean but. I never thought it would be

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:53.000
that happy.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:58.000
You know something I felt like such a citizen

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:03.000
you know like I have rights the end of it you know in a way I mean

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.000
I you know I've talked to you about this it's not.

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:11.000
You know being a lesbian in New York in the twenty first century is not that hard

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:16.000
and you know you don't have to be closeted and you know we

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:21.000
had through my my job we had health insurance we were

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:25.000
domestic partners and we had you know health insurance she was covered by my health

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:30.000
insurance we had you know any time I had been hospitalized several times with

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:35.000
broken bones and various things during our relationship and no one

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:40.000
ever. Had her in to see me or you know and nothing you

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:41.000
know we.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Well we've really got you know logistically from the marriage

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:52.000
was the ability to file federal income tax jointly

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:57.000
and let me tell you something. My refund before we were

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.000
married when I would file with her just as a dependent and I would file

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:06.000
head of household. I would get like fourteen hundred dollars

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:11.000
back from the feds. Once I started being able to file

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:16.000
jointly. Married find. My. My refund like

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:20.000
. Almost tripled. I was getting like thirty thirty eight hundred dollars It was

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
unbelievable.

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:25.000
It was I was like Man these headers.

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Now this is the shit right and it's also because of like things like if you're

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:36.000
married and you you know one partner dies one spouse dies

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:40.000
the other one gets to inherit everything without having to pay

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:45.000
tax. Whereas if you were domestic partners you know that's not true.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:50.000
So it really was a financial thing but that's not what we'd be happy. It was I was just so happy to

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:54.000
be an Elizabeth it was happy too. We were very happy and then you know

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:59.000
sadly things whereof to the agency where I was working at the

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:04.000
time it was right around then that things started going badly for me I started

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:09.000
arguing with upper management and feeling like there was a deep philosophical

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.000
split in how I felt about the services we worked I was a

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:19.000
nonprofit manager for vision we have agency

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:25.000
and I started feeling like you know my judgment was being second

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:29.000
guessed and you know and I and I just became very very unhappy and.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.000
You know as as I became more unhappy at work I started taking that unhappiness out

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:40.000
at home. On and I think that then

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
accelerated the end of the marriage

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:47.000
. I'm not sure it would've come anyway but. On. My knee

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:52.000
and that's I think why it was easy for me to blame myself. For so long.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Right because you know I was the one who was so miserable and I would wake

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:02.000
up in the morning and start bitching about something anything you know just because I didn't want to go

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:07.000
to work and I didn't want to deal with it and as time went on because I went I stayed at

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:12.000
that place three more years you know. It just got worse and worse

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000
and I got more and more angry. That must have been really hard to live with.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:23.000
You know where my memory is working in the technology. Did

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:27.000
you did you have a they were before that it was that with a whip

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000
.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.000
Yeah when I first I mean of course you know my

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:37.000
first earliest jobs were at a university is all my fellowships

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
on.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:43.000
So that was like researching type work. On. It

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.000
. And then.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:52.000
When I came back to New York in eighty nine and I didn't know what I was going

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:57.000
to do because I was like I have trained to be a college professor.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:15:01.000
But I couldn't be a college professor because I didn't have my Ph D. and I

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:04.000
didn't and so I.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:09.000
But I had learned to you know to use computer technology and I was really good at it

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:14.000
you know and this was back when it was you know it was

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:19.000
and that sort of you know command line oriented text oriented

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:24.000
operating system so it was really easy for blind people to to learn because there was no

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:29.000
point and click. There were no more icons there were no graphics. Everything was done through

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:34.000
typing Manzi or memorizing function keys and we actually

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:39.000
had a big advantage with that because as most of us have better memory is for that

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:43.000
kind of thing because we practice them especially back in the pre really pre-computer

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:44.000
days.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.000
So I started looking for jobs teaching teaching Putins

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000
. And the first couple jobs like God.

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:58.000
On were the very first I worked

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:03.000
just transcription typing for journalists. Friend of mine had a

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:08.000
friend who was working you know it was a freelance writer

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:13.000
and I did you know like I transcribe lots of interviews for him and for colleagues

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:18.000
and then Tom my friend and I also did some ghostwriting for him because we were a freelance writer who

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:23.000
take every single assignment because you can't turn down work but you can always write

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:28.000
everything so he would just pass us stuff we write and then he did it you

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:33.000
know. But I was terrified but the real first job I got was at La Guardia

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:38.000
Community College in a program called Computer Olympics

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:43.000
and it was a summer program and it was for kids fourteen

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:46.000
to sixteen.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:54.000
You know what is euphemistically described as what are they say are at risk. Which you know

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
again usually means black and brown kids you know

02:16:56.000 --> 02:17:01.000
. So she encouraged

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:05.000
instead computers are fun and school is fun and you should stay in school.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:11.000
So all on and indeed I was the only the only white instructor in

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:14.000
the in the program.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Well there was a young man Caucasian man was like a lab tech

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:24.000
but it was a great experience I really love the people I worked with.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Sandy Watson I got to give her a shout out she said Dean. Now it already in

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:34.000
the workforce development program. She's amazing woman.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:39.000
I learned so much from her. I mean just her attitude you

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:44.000
know when this blind woman walked in to teach classes to interview

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:49.000
for a position teaching classes all Sandy did was come over to me and say now. And

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:54.000
she was you know a language that is you know politically super practical you know.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:59.000
I see you're differently abled or something like that you know she said So what can I do. What do I need to

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:04.000
do to help. Right and I thought this is beautiful. I cannot

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:09.000
believe this woman is just like not saying you're blind you can't work here or because I

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:13.000
don't have that kind of experience you know before in job interviews even they flat out

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:18.000
said it or they clearly thought it

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:22.000
interesting and were smart enough not to say it again so creating a

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000
so.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:28.000
A state was but you know whatever.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:33.000
So Sandy hired me and I taught that program and then there was another

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:36.000
program that they had gotten a grant for called

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:40.000
. I want to see a job were

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:45.000
bound but that's not what it was called but it was like that it was you know at a basic GED

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:50.000
GED prep and then or three tracks I think for the kids could go

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:54.000
through either computer training you know computer

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:58.000
applications food service or automotive and so I taught the computer

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:03.000
piece. And this was all so I think it's mind you but it was

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:08.000
really easy and you know I was word perfect and Lotus and D. base

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:13.000
back when we had an accessible database of used. And you know

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:18.000
interesting the kids loved the bass that was their favorite product to work on

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:23.000
. And I stayed there a good two years I stayed there until I

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:28.000
got offered my position at Lighthouse which in I got in one thousand nine hundred two

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:34.000
but I also at the time I also interviewed before work while I was still because I was a

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:38.000
part time job I also got a job with a level ninety nine the

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Consortium for workers education is part of you know and there I was teaching like

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000
retired union members to learn computers

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:52.000
. But my real first big job job

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:57.000
was with lighthouse in one thousand nine hundred ninety two as an assistant tech

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:02.000
instructor and that was I was twenty nine. And it was a full time

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:07.000
job with benefits and a real salary and of course it was in White Plains

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:12.000
So that was a schlep. I did that for seven years man I mean

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:16.000
by by the time mid ninety's came around as I mentioned earlier when I was on my

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:21.000
last will and testament you know I got a few promotions that I was working both

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:26.000
out of the White Plains office and you know and I had some staff out there that could do a lot of

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:31.000
the work for me at White Plains. So I also that work at fifty ninth Street office which was much more

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:36.000
convenient and I was there you know till ninety nine and then

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:41.000
I was sent to New York Medical College for a little while Westchester Institute for Human

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Development. We left because it was too hard to be

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:51.000
with with a lighthouse like take the train into White Plains you know the measure of

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:56.000
the earth and I could just walk to the lighthouse was like four or five block walk. But with that house

02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:01.000
I had to. Take care. Of my putting the train to

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:05.000
North White Plains and taking a little shuttle bus on to the medical college campus

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:10.000
but that was less than I ever worked with an orientation and mobility specialist

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:15.000
because the other track. The stationary North white

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:20.000
is really like true it's a double edge platform and there's all kinds

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:25.000
of like a banshee isn't any sign I mean

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:30.000
it just felt so unsafe and I as I've said I have you know balance

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:34.000
problems and I just didn't I was scared to take the train and so

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:40.000
you know it just became too expensive and and also you know if I wasn't going

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:44.000
to go back and do a Ph D. there was really not going to be any future for me there.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:50.000
So but the only other words that I ever do that was not what assistive type

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:55.000
oriented I mean certainly my last job where I was like the director of a department

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:59.000
and oversaw the computers as well as employment and

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:04.000
you know and in youth development programs but the only other job I

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:09.000
had didn't really involve tech so much

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:12.000
was when I was with the American Foundation for the blind.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:16.000
I was there from two thousand and one

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:21.000
. To two thousand and five and I was the project coordinator for

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:25.000
. A project called the nationally standardized minimum

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:30.000
dataset and that was looking into. What

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:34.000
data should be collected on from.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:40.000
You know the older blind programs. What data should we have

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
teachers.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Collect. In order to get it and how should it be

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:51.000
collected in order to get. A sort of nationally.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:56.000
Standardized snapshot. Of what people's older blind

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:57.000
folks.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:23:01.000
Abilities. And interests were and that was a

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:06.000
program that existed project existed in both the.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Policy about policy research and program evaluation Department and the

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Department of Aging at. A.F.P. so I got to work with

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:20.000
two really amazing women who are the CO principal

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:25.000
investigators a current Kirchner who was very very well known in the

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:29.000
blindness field she's written. Some amazing books

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:34.000
. On data collection and policy and then

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Alberta or who was the director of the senior programs there

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:44.000
and she said and that's you know Grant is retired. She's well into her seventy's

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:49.000
. And. I think. That's right. I mean

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:54.000
I learned about policy research and program evaluation and how do

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:59.000
you collect and analyze data and look at it in meaningful

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.000
ways and that has really driven.

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:08.000
The. Successive developments in my career that's how I think I

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:13.000
became such a successful grants writer because I knew how

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:18.000
to. Make something outcomes

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:23.000
oriented and say Here are the outcomes we predict and here's how we're going to

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:27.000
get there and that's all because of what I've learned. Working underground in Alberta

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:32.000
. In fact you know I still always entertain the idea of going back to

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:37.000
school because that's why that's my bent but I chose kind email from the

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:41.000
N.Y.U. alumni program office that N.Y.U. as a

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:46.000
master's in quantitative. Data Usage or something like that

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:51.000
quantitative analysis and I you know I got high when I saw it.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:56.000
It's like this is exactly exactly what I want to do but I can you know I

02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:01.000
don't think I can. I don't I can't certainly can't afford to go back to N.Y.U.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:06.000
now unless I got the commission to pay for it but I guess I could work

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:07.000
that you know.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:12.000
I'm quite sure if I decided to go back to school I could get you know get another

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:17.000
fellowship that it's really not that hard you just have to be willing you know to

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:22.000
work at a menial job. And all and get

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:26.000
a little bit of money but get your wish and paid for. But I you know that's I think

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:31.000
something that young people especially young blind people don't really think about

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:36.000
. And I'm not sure they're counseled about it. Well it depends on the

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:41.000
counselors some counselors are great at you know but you know I don't think

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:46.000
kids realize when I was a friend of mine you know in your sixty's and a

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:51.000
few years ago and I said I don't know I kind of want to go back to school but I want you to

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:56.000
see if we can find money you can always find them you know I think that's true. You know I do think

02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:01.000
that's true. So my you know. After I left Penn

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:05.000
I was like well you know I would have had my Ph D. by the time I was thirty if I'd stayed

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:10.000
on. Then when I left I was always planning on finishing well get it by the time thirty

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.000
five that we met and then I thought well by the time I'm forty I could still do it and then in

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.000
my forty's I think you know I could still do this but it's fifty.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:23.000
So now I'm fifty two and like you know if I sat down and if I do it

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:28.000
now I could still have it by the time I'm sixty I could still have fifteen to

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:33.000
twenty more years of a career at a college you know which is what I would have wanted so

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:33.000
.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:38.000
I'll. End on this note I saw a. Report

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:43.000
this morning that said there is actually significant

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.000
.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Data academic research now showing. That

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:54.000
. Our myths about aging that we have so many myths about aging is

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.000
one of the biggest myths is that people become more

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.000
depressed and happy as they grow older.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:07.000
And it turns out that that's not true that there's a

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:12.000
period in the late forty's early fifty's where people get a little

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:17.000
anxious and. Aren't sure. Right. But then we had

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:22.000
fifty years and all. People are just. Life gets better

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:27.000
. People are happier. I mean there's there's significant data to indicate that

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:32.000
this is true. So. You know I'm feeling like

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:36.000
OK you know I'll be fifty three in three months you know

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
four months and.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.000
So that's you know. That's headed into a good.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Yeah I don't know

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:52.000
if you have anything else that you and I and I think this is

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:57.000
a good thing like these folks have a lot you

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:00.000
know.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:03.000
Well thank you it's been it's been a pleasure. It's been my pleasure

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:07.000
. I

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:12.000
. Mean I am. Me.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Let's. Go.
