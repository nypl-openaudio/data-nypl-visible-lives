00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello, my name is Catherine Parker and I'm going to have a conversation with Shanequa Gowans

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
for Visible Lives an Oral History Project

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
at the New York Public Library. It is January 21st

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
2015 and this is being recorded at City College

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
of New York.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Isn't that what it's called? of New York City's Oh

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you don't you don't go to City College, OK.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So, when how old are you. 25

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.000
one.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And what is your disability.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Growing up is hard of hearing and I read

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
lips I found though that I had a little

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
bone problem with ?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Growing up it was, you I know I didn't realize it. My biggest dis-my biggest issue

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
was hard of hearing because I wasn't able to like

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
understand, basically, like hearing people so I

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
knew as uh, growing up I was able to like um

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
to listen to people by reading lips and

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I guess by watching a lot.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So nobody never understood that but my family so they knew I had hearing problems

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but I didn't understand that ,the type of hearing problems I had. So as a young ?ages since, I didn't

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
like really kinda like, you know, kind hear because

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I wasn't you know understanding what was really going on because people used

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to go she's crazy, you she can't hear, she's deaf

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
she don't know what she talking about.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So no I don't like things up when we make a mistake of actually seen

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and I used to play channel you know anybody lake or my

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
name would be three to one it's two times and.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Whisper room was kind of like heart so in a go when I felt like people are still getting up just

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
kind of like in I didn't feel comfortable like

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
participating in a lot of groups because I feel like

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I was actually left out which I was or I was in the group but I

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
was like sitting there in the kind of quiet because I was able to listen

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to these and watch what's going on around me

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
so that was kind of me being a Christian is a hard a year so I was

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
able to become a stronger better person is

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
by reading lips and watching people.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So when I mean when when I went to school ahead of

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
time tough times like an air flight member really like

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
in their routine and sometimes that was Irene but certain words I think once I

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
found out that I had a speech discrimination with them to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
hear and so I didn't stay in a minute or so. So I don't know

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
what I mean when I was young growing up now though. It's like an old party here

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
again here interesting. You're here in the X. in China only

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
focus.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Only things that I like to do and when I was growing

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
up it was Conolly it was easy because I was

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
quite doing what I came to the things that I can see to do

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
. But being in a new group I always

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
wanted to get in

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and do what was rolling me we wanted to with the New World was able to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
catch up with everybody and you see it so

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
it was late.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Affiliate I was just like you know being in the universe and a lot of the group a group

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
of people who've been trying to be friends with him would be like five or

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
ten people because I always had to look around and watch everybody's talking

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and it's kind of hard it was foolishly so it is why

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
you know what kind

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
. So you're How hard of hearing are you CAN

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
YOU ARE SO do you wear a

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
hearing aid that you are hearing aid and when you don't have your hearing aid on are you

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
completely deaf.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Those are hard to hear like right now. I've been hearing strong all firm right. I mean my left

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
side because we want to hear an exceptionally degree appear in it. OK

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
so I guess it

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
actually has lips it actually can spring right engine is actually

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
right now of the hearing aids and they actually do it is hard to balance it

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
sometimes used to hear my hearing because I didn't get here in

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
the world of around two thousand each at best the first

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
time I get a free spirit leaks that it had in the

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
units in the understand how did you figure out what didn't work

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
so I knew this but down here really slick though.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
What happened right here in the US Some of the tone comes up so I noticed

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
lately now like sometimes it's like what am I hearing in this year is like a here I

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
came here to things but if I hear everybody look decide my attention turns on this I knew

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
somebody is calling me so I have to teach the person so it's late

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
even if I were going in like a job.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
The old it's kind of hard because I know there's a gene to late taking the notice stayed

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
a list a lot of time in school because I'm

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
trying to get like a new Tikker which I fill it was kind of hard to do with it

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
because I was used to work but in no way did it was hard to

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
hear the professor told in the media right at the same time.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So let me try to really do try to communicate it was so

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
easily that I have a little bit

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
different mission so that was kind of getting inside school college for

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
me and and in C. They need to ignore outing in my services

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
because. Now I know they did it was hard at the college and

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
the people need to understand. So it's kind of hard they had to fight at the same time I mean you

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
know what I did in what type of services didn't you that's

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
what we did I feel comfortable with. So they started using certain

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
services and they had to like try they definitely sometimes it is hard even though

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
they gave me a duty but sometimes it was kind of our

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
understanding or either you

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
know fortunately it wasn't I wasn't used to we have to get

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
rid of and for differing so that we all agree is something

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
organizes the work. So. Listen it really

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
hard to hear and it's it's really complicated for me because even though it on charm

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and there is like a multi-task two things they give you any talk in

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
there it's kind of like a moose a little mission because I occasionally misunderstood shared

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
a densely powerlessly I'm actually following

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
somebody especially too seriously even in school I had to

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
sit in the front and it always in a fright Actually

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
it was a professor. But the problem is trying to do my

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
work at the same time it's kind of heart so I knew this my biggest

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
disability is right here.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So where did you grow up. I was

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
born in Queens.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I was raised I was actually

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
at the age of four or five.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Four five six Berkeley brothers playing reached in Queens

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
then priest in Berkeley and came back some of those

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
can only means

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Seventy six seventy

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
seventy six to sixty years and what neighborhood in

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Queens right now.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I mean I'm still only it

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
looks like from the sky like between Queens and

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
socially is for a misprint there where you say never

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
home you know when I was buying a used

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
cell phones I saw it was on you know

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Rockaway Boulevard you know of the

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
probes.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Like sprint for us. So what was it like

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.000
growing up.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Oh no it wasn't me I was fine family was

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.000
feeling of being around people who are missing

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and I got some for a plane around.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It was kind of it was kind of

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I think it was kind of like vi only because

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Bush League currently broke the

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
English league owned it on growing this

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
kind of violence and items over his cue to her it was always fights

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
going on the only being around so many people who

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
everybody grew up on the scene that was on the black as if you were grown up and you will grow

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
like a family or not but it was kind of like hard

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
because for me I was everybody that I was always like why I was

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
always playing basketball most of those I guess I was like the tomboy because I used to love

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
sports you know this couple and the football I played

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
a lot again. So but being around people was kind of hard to

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
use that people really talk about because I didn't I didn't

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
have my here and he said I didn't hear him except Tom in.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I wasn't really I didn't pay attention to basically my

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
hearing but I know I knew I had a hearing problem but I didn't

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
understand that it was getting worse and hate

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
to get early testing and hearings because

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
there's a little disappointing it was too sweet and you know it's going to do when

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
about to put his cars ahead tubes being put in my ears

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
but I know it is. I used to watch people to serve as a visual in

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
reading. People always talk about you and it was kind of late

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
. I mean really paid attention only good of a C. satellite

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
whatever work I will walk away because I wasn't the type of person that

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
it's like to fight or whatever so I have hair like so many negative

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
comments they like to see for it so are the

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
people we're in who grew up on. I was

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
always that why you wanted a little bit just sleep it was like I felt like I was

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
business more because it was kind of hard. Oh I understand the guy here but did

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
she say she stays out of their drama and it was kind of saying I'm sitting here

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
in that era was it like when somebody with a little torn except

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
especially because it's hard to hear the voice meaning speak they've got a deep voice and when

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
you talk so it was really you know I just used to keep

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
whatever but I mean people who make frenemy

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
happening they just left in this and I see a certain

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
muted like detention and that sort of ways but with some of the excellent question you

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
know girls think you know but equally

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
when I was I used to sit next to a person visit was

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
that it was called but it was equally nobody like screamed loud enough or tall

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
very tired so he was talking to me that there's like a death

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
in the audience and it hit me it's a lot like

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
odor so as late as I don't you know I notice sometimes I don't

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I mean I'm home.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
It's it's not late and young girl enough older than I So it's like

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
we think she's quietly when I go home it's just me and my brother and my parents like everybody

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
posting only Everybody's in a little room just again.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
BURTON So it's legal. Quaid areas and you

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
know everybody everybody come out and see how far I usually go to the late Margaret

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and go visit sometimes you know I would have prickly and mess around with my cousins

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
sisters and school was even in

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
college as well as my social years though I don't know a lot of

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
people who I didn't have any other so there's a lot of

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
guys also because of my major Being sick of my field it was like technology that's

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
something that keeps me going through here

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
he is on so I knew this. And he really didn't have our

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
friends like I didn't have too much friends but I had a lot of social So it was just

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
like totally you doing here. Sometimes on his watch or if I have time I'll sit

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
down but I notice it's

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Connelly it's hot it's kind of hard for me to

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
China roti dignity logically

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
so I'll leave this meanie for usually sometimes I can get away with a whole lot of

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
people like you sometimes it do my hearing sometimes I have to just do it because

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
even my hearing you know I have to balance it when I just hear

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
the sounds of people who say we have more people that she

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
was talking to me if I do you know most people in

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
here and she was handsome.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
So here I think it's this way as if I was actually

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
around your neck you have a gray it's like a long acting

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.000
so.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Phone and long acting or kind of and then yeah I was that

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
it's a it's like a stream a pro it's

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
someone hearing me and I can only answer my phone.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Oh this isn't my music. Oh oh

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
oh I can just see if I know I have a teeny point me to just do T.V.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
sounds in the host so everybody has a TON of the T.V.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
show versus if we made a hex to watch T.V. so

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
they have their communication in-house and turn everything but here it's a free attorney do

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
you know that it gives a community to my own tongue

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
around the house.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So it works to get my hearing so when you don't want to hear the

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
T.V. you can use the T.V. device and when you want the volume to be

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
higher in the T.V. you can turn it higher for yourself and no one else nobody

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
else can hear it will need some of this work this is only because I can hear it on my hearing me well as

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
my hearing explode so you just kind of like turn the volume up on your hearing aid.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
OK so then everything else around you is ample time to you

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
know this sounds like it's a very well traveled and well as you

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
could slip if I try to be a sort of phone sometimes.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Well the doctor put a program when he again sort of prissy laughed at their house and

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
so my phone started ringing. I can press the

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
button just here but the actual greens if I hear any so into the

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
ear. Gauges actually hear a person but don't know how to switch of

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
excellence like reprogram birds that uprights because once the background noise

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
. When folks go to theater I want to punch a kraut so I can actually

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
focus on the personalization to against everybody else

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
It's kind of like a live technology. Yes well go to school. Why just strategy. Where

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
did you see see you know this major computing there were a

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
technology and a little like fix what troubleshoot

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
technology trying to learn how to build pro worldwide to

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
program program and plenty of technology. Now something

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
they got was always a loved video instantly so much media means all

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
sorts of like the game being the cursing and why was this

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.000
year

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
. How old I am now twenty five. How do I know you know where I

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
am games.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
I was playing and you know some of

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
these but since I don't have time I usually play some games and

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
have played a little games like I have Playstation looked at playing basketball or

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Sunday whenever you know it's not. Yeah Year three lovely those games

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
with time no going to school. And trying to

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
have their time so easily fix computers and

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
shooting. Let them do an internal review and rightly

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
so all this is a school junior high school in Far

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Rockaway Beach channel I think somewhere far

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
away where what do you do. T.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
technician that you need to do to actually fix the computers look

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
at Charlie Sheen the technology and so do you see anything anything he thinks are

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
basically God to fix it with school. How did you

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
find out about that you apply for an armed robbers already in school I

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
mean based on my major from the school of doing all the career

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
theorists unless. It's like a whole

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
translation has the hammer phrase and me well it was already part of a programme at the

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
crash of the kidney gradually since the hair was so well it is programs during the summer

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
as the two up on the program what are you trying to work around with

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
the technology and when they went

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.000
back to school. I put down my resume in

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
to after school the school's Korea fear they will still hate people

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
fitted to areas inside of you and I do you know what was in the novel

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
too. If you're sending those in Exley to give me a list of schools that I

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
wanted to participate in. Sister Sharon so I was actually

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
on essentially a paid internship national finish in June it was funny

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
because I graduated in the beginning of the

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
program. Now I'm just an article. So for me to

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
be in a program about to continue which is what they're supposed to vary

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
so there we can actually keep stable I feel that there

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
are a now it's kind of hard at least I'm trying to take it easy because I just graduated

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
and I'm one of the fish in the game that I had to pull to because now register and

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
have to make sure that the school is going to hit the series has been made

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
of the club which I'm going to go to.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.000
So.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
So tell me you know

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
like elementary school you want to

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
. Think I

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
went through with it but

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
they know it's a school in Queens. P.S. ninety six

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
she moved the hitting it was a year so we

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
have to point in there was born and

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
raised here in the bathroom with you know much about elementary school

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
you know and so do you remember and Metro Middle School

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
where he went to school.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
That's OK

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
I mean you know going to school in Brooklyn is kind of there's all

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
this I mean I wasn't there because I was I was a person I mean it wasn't

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
a school that I was always a person and I

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
felt like I was a business person and I was always always participated

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
in it and it was really it was kind of

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
hard at the same time right.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
But about the world like the burn them.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Well what about that was hard

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
I.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Think I had to learn to get used to changing classes where you got to

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
switch rooms and room it in it was easy because he was different publishers so

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
uniforms was different needing a

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
change of classes and in trying to do work and

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
it was a drama so I mean school movies.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.000
But.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
I mean I've been at it I'm injured.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Although I still have hard to hear and understand it so now I don't know how I was

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
passing I think I may be able to do for

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
the feelings of my song because and at a certain

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
level headed late

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
or no way banks and there is concern about that they have put

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
me inside of the special players that adding new players in

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
either I was concerned but they didn't explain it I felt like it and explain to me

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
why I was moved and I felt like the students repeating because they kept seeing a specialty

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
so I lost a lot of us it was a special special especially

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
special special year of two teachers in the year when

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
everybody had to change classes and we have to stay there you don't change the courses.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
So you know I mean comfortable when I was there but I just never had

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
to do was to fill out all kinds and

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
in this state while he's been in this but I think when I started like six Kerry

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
it isn't really explained to me you were quoting parents you

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
know I don't know what was split excluding building have a cup of whip

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
basically where you train for a week I just got a paper.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Everything the people say you know he moved cities to Egypt where they have no

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
results that it's getting over to try to finish to trying to

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
gradually years that's what I can

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
remember besides all the faiths creating the ask what school did you

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
go to see to ninety six clubs in Bushwick which are in their

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000
right state you have are you didn't participate as you now

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
really know propaganda closely I mean and they really have much weight.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
If a meeting high school is a slate everybody then everybody knows if

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
we have the thirty people grew up with some appearance people each

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
other there's kind of like the Who left any area where I lived in the area which had a whole

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
school those years it was it

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
was a great I mean really clearly.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
When it's when you come home and get out of

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
school. And those are what kind of things would be all fights about

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
this some don't quite see that relationships really.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Was she saying he sees. A little he was crazy I don't know he was just so

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
many aid to schools like planes was at night and I don't even know which story that

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
they should proceed to aegis of

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
those that are fights are based on a he say she say so I don't know because I was always in the gym

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
playing basketball. Well either I think I did a lot of doing to

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
step into the team.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Dear Daughter please ask me

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
because I was always around a lot of police play that person's ups

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
just ask for a plain rope a little bit of

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000
this and I think it's

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
maybe a hand I think I actually did have one for I guess that on the side of my hip with a

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
pin I can't remember why

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
I just heard an about Steptoe

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
. What if I don't miss out on my head and it was a four year old

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
I don't know why what was that I can remember it is just a

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
picture. Let's go to the hospital. Look at the hospital and into the

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
hospital. He did it worry you were bleeding and there I think was fine

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
I wanted to be sure of my skin with the guns on the side of my head and

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
it's up early but noting with the two of us who

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
was held in a form that I was the first fighter a very

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
big six interested there was only a freshman

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
year sixth grade.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Does that mean.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
What was a building like that he lived in the building.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Yeah definitely a house or partly it

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
was a like a partly right

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
. I like enough already I feel sorry

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
for the first two floors to be a

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
different world.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
As a first to me my mom and my grandma Flo was

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
my mom or my aunt my father son moments I want to win the

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000
title for this I wouldn't say before.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
So then after my last day at high school where to get a high school high

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
school.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Freshman year I went to school in ACORN High School for Social Justice

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
to you in my freshman year one thousand three hundred in their

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
natural spirit to Queens when you blue moon we moved because

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
travel for so I went to school in Queens and sold

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
a lot of forcing the public secretly testing of

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Queens

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
. I'm going to let it out yet again so.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And what it is that when you.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Figure it out.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Technology I wonder do you do you not also always mess

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
around who those missing became what it was or stuff I was always

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:36.000
breaking things they try to put it back together like my video games.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Please to take my Playstation two and turn it into a turned it

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
into who own. A computer like the head of windows

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000
because it was able to get in the Internet is somehow one day I

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
was just playing around I was on You Tube and a motive might be every like

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
they had already been in a meeting of world a movie

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
would put it in there. That's about P.S.P. it was in pursuit like you know when I was really

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
into me it was like oh Mike you saw all of this mean brain I'm

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
so used to play so much video games and had all the technology and came up

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
with this like the Game Stick have come you know and

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
it just came out this computers

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
and there's always a computer monitor.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Continue your and that they don't really mean that it used to just a bizarre

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
computer one to really turn off the computer and showed kids the

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000
teacher we should we have to go to the programs and then of the monitor had to show the kids.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Well as a student the monitor had to leak. We should call Peter a show

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
to make sure the programs are on the computer. So from you

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
know dear Mr Because I used to have a word specific you would

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
use in a monitor and as a monitor I

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
don't think you already did it was late when I was growing up I said

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
I was I wanted to be a criminal just because I want to get up

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
and I was really you know want to be a

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
boss an awesome manager.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
With the police or security guards or police officers

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
something all of the criminal justice inside that field and

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
the school that came from this beast doing my high school there was a lot different

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
division society. I mean there were

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
classes there which is going for a six and it was

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
programs they hated the school put out they participated in it because

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
that's what a school with only had two years before we started it while there were three year

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
and I found a lead about the programs they

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
like program for Pell P.T.O. we already have like

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
you train the kids and it's like a program for like programs only

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000
read in the police legally and ethically and I mean

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
I found out the information slowly so I didn't really think so and it's just going to get

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
out of school. Double problem now at the school. I tried

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
doing the best one teen.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000
No playbook. Splits up people.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
But after I started realizing that I didn't want to be

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
I mean I think we had to get out of his doctor's appointments that way

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
but I started seeing myself I didn't really have much friends like I was socialize with everybody

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
. Lunch it is not just like Obama spoke so rarely

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
and when I knew my hearing Muskegon nowheres was

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
on I think we had to repeat the ruse. To call

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
chatters so repeat that we had to see the person being me passing the ball.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
He's doing practice and so he puts a cage and I can't listen

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
to the coach thing I can remember thinking he screen

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
name and on any Ted

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Ted making mistakes is no way they are doing the head of playing

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
the practice and laying I feel like and the next two days are in

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
combat. Why because.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Because I felt way

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
late. I can't listen up and I mean I

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
hear I mean it was like it was

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
like it's like nobody caught up with me to see it was born

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
white and the F. each floor hit here in problems so I didn't feel

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
as high school my hearing it was like a little bit because like people was a

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:18.000
life ending.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
He remembers saying we can only see just what he called my

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
name and a hand like a really hard time here in Atlanta. So it's like a lot of things that I

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
miss them with a lot of things I mean things and Indian I notice when I had to take my

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
tests. An English regions and I feel the English

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
test because if you're going to take in and nobody did and you know we

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
had no idea and had an affiliation with a school didn't even know me

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
and I felt I felt a test by

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
five points because tweaking so I didn't have any loops Eastern to

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
answer the questions so I had to take the test a second

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000
time I guess because I was a visual where I was really into personal

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
attacks.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
So as a rent a person lives right things that I would see the

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
person saying so what were you going through that moment when you're

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
taking the test and you were reading the person's lips and then you realize that

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
you like how how difficult was it for you to hear the person.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Actually it was Carmen it was hard when they hardly ever know because my

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
mom told me you know she was going to sing to the doctor to

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
see whats going on but we didn't go as soon or late I was great

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
at that right on this one I think where in between school

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
graduated this when I went back to the doctor it was it

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
was it was hard but I don't know I just work and

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
certain things I think as they got into it so much like anything that I

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
know will help me do a lot of things is because of technology. I would

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
get on the computer and Google something if I needed it and he denied it you

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
know.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Oh yes well you know I mean it's funny for me shit myself

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:18.000
.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
It did everything he should have done that I needed to present

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
They even eclairs I used to get a trouble flicky English because

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
I was loosely we had to do a group reading along you know the class reading

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
unit chapter books and reading the story I was currently clueless because

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
you know it. Give good teacher everybody inside the class read

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
so we had to go back to whatever. So by the time it was my go because

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:54.000
some people do real well but some people read a little because they were

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
afraid to read aloud. So it's kind of hard

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
. So I think you know I didn't honestly you know like I would really unless it's

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
late I filled it hurt because it was like you know this is going to be paying attention

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
and seeing the you know in my mind of SR I mean no no but the sea

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
as I was not my fault that I was you know in the story in letting this day

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
nobody can't fuck wit me basically based on my hearing even from

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
school. My hero who's I mean from feeling is Olympics and now

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
even this one seemingly went a switch and you know I have resources I mean

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
I had a resource in the tree school with me and taken out of class

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
for me so it's for ever read it.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
And the women fighting over a couple with their different bitching

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
tools like I do when they do like remotely getting repeating to me

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Everybody's a little late she said pleasantly Agreed but it was late.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Nobody understand.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
I passed my classes because nobody realized that I always look

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
look at the religious people will lose the going gets leave

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
like why she stay or leave before you know and I believe

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
the last I had to visualize the price of two hundred doctors things like Well when I went

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
to college and because some people are now we're already hearing Beatles learning

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
but I just grew up reading only it is so strong I

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
think if I didn't know how to read the area that is

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
a visual and read it and window here without hearing

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
it seems like it was kind of like a lot of things.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
It's kind of like hard so how old were you when you were you

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
lad learnt you were reading maps and ingesting on your own no one

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
you realise that the only way you could understand people was by reading our laps

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.000
and and.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
And then you found out that your hard of hearing do you hear if there is

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
a real way. See we knew when I was a baby I was actually hard of hearing. I

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
wanted to fill out to fill my ear.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Did anyone know that you know my mom you know she remembered

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
why I don't know that or anything like that but

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
I'm on your mom up here everybody was like me feeling new.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
But growing up being noticed late. But here it was getting

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
worse. OK so. What I'm saying

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
in school was like you know what it isn't paying attention to me yet a pizza

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
agented it either because I tried to figure out why everybody you know

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
playing I used to just well being maybe an only child I was always an

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
independent because I was just the only girl you know it's just me about world

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
. So when the two of us he's only twelve thirteen. So I

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
mean the only channel like dignity and she being

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
overprotective So you know it's like kneeling getting ready to hear from you know

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
how people would you know listen participate you like all I want to do this and get

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
it but when I realized what I was working in groups like evil we

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
headed to where I was always styled or information I don't know that I

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
could have done better. Being

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
on a plane put myself in a room with everybody

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
to the end of this communication is kind of hard. Ian Lee Yeah sometimes

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
I do go see it like I see my counsellor some days later when she

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
needs to actually go to King she always

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
told me what's going on. Whatever. So it's like it's kind of

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
hard even like I notice when I'm around like college people and now when I'm out

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
but sometimes I feel like when I mean everybody like a group I feel like I'm

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
left out because it's really hard for me to actually eat. It's a lock and you say things in

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
our city or even if I felt like the conversation started I wouldn't be able

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
to now actually trying to find Louis defeat but sometimes it be things that people

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000
talk about that I just don't know I don't want to be involved in. So

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
yeah like that. So even though now like sometimes they're

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
its heart like my hearing aids because sometimes I'm just I'm

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
curious way in school. But I noticed when I first started when I hear unease as

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
empty I started to feel cheated because I do differently if this is like. HEADLEE

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
hearing students in that human face. So the first time they started

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
of they started with a video quirk recorder but it wasn't a

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
regular video because it was a recording veterans like somebody

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
come into play music nearly twice the big movie so

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
they were trying to get a professor and from their point nest started

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000
going sort of Dr Martin over to China Sea where it was actually working for me

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
. So now that I've found weight and it technology was moving etc My

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
She has a widow what I was interested when I hear a neat

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
but I have every now and I've had my phone in

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
my approach and like at home. So you know people

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
acting in a lot of jobs they really are a

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
skater printing different kind of resume your daughter had experience for different things. It's not

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
our problem is in answering the phones. You will hear her teeth

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
because over the phone I can't hear it or see a home have a caption call

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
screen so sometimes I don't hate a person.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
These screen thinks that what they say so on the

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
stand for Sometimes I still don't know what the hearings now to have my hearing me but when I

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
get a phone because it's quite a I can hear everything but if I don't like and roll out

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
a new easy area it's kind of like hostility

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
really balances and I have to like I just ate so sometimes I don't travel in some

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
of the numbers that are no. Sort of foreign travel to oil simply

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
because our son he only everything like the streets I hear the car is the

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
house in the trying to hear the person like it's really hard

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
to really sleep.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Unfortunately some things I don't think about it this kind is harping

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000
on the old idea it's late as it goes.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000
They guess it like growing up I didn't really hear you never and paying attention

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000
is like the old adage so late it is because it's

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
like even my internship since I'll be fixin things like to sing

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
I'm sitting in the front and the secretary sits behind me

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
until late.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Three weeks.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
She's call them I mean so she goes an equal so so my position equal enormous on but when I hear you

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
on the level told police that's my notice somebody called attention she

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
like you little pitch so it's kind of like really

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000
like ours like oh it's when I hear her voice I know which way it's coming from so it

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
might seem I hear my hearing aid.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
That's where the rector person but it's like even though she's talking

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:55.000
sometimes it's like I can't hear Lee I did hear things but there are words

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
to speak the words I can't really catch what they're saying. At best part

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
of her ear and basically it's like I've got a speech discrimination and it's like

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
it's really like Hartley. If they say

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
well if this is really busy and you hear everybody she's talking at the same time

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:20.000
but I can't write once on the game who have us talking this lake and have a look at

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
a person that record you see what they say versus you know everybody we said.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
That's what I notice when I see it it is our shot explained

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000
you know they find if we use for us to adjust the year we need so much

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000
better because like I knew this night it was a lot of people who see

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000
late in a party let them even quiting office where

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.000
within a busy year and you hear everybody like you know like it's like a everybody voice

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000
but I have to look at the person to actually hear what they see

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
as our film upbringing like my mom doesn't like asteroid

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
kitsch that reflection is in that rating but I hear your voice but I'd be

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
like ha good Did you see as the weird things that idiot boy

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
but I don't know where it's. Because it's kind of hard like I can't

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
explain it's like it's really already is just like

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
music like playing music you know legs and Zone music because

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
it's dear but it was like a lot of people you're still going to have to look at the person

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
is actually talking to me it's not a listing of of

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
the only ways but I hear what you said

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
exactly what it was like it's kind of horrific really being horn here or

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
It's our Anything else you want to say on the recording that we haven't

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
touched on yet I think you know I'll

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000
say this I think this is a good opportunity to actually expressions the

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Yankee is sort of

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
disability even though I mean like. So that will cause some type to talk

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
you don't want to always told people like your problems but it is

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
certain certain reactions that you know you can

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.000
light there's ways you can you hope to understand

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
things to protect yourself.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
To not show people why are you doing this because sometimes you know people look at you like

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.000
you're crazy, but you do certain things for a reason. So it's like with me 

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
sometimes like when people talk to them sometimes I gotta really look at their faces like

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000
hearing, like I wouldn't want to stare at you just to stare at you. If you're actually saying something to me

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000
and actually looking at you it's because I'm reading lips. So sometimes I have to like, even at work

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000
sometimes I have to be like, yeah, oh no I'm hard of hearing. So you know for me to look

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
I don't like to say that all the time.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Sometimes it does...I mean

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.000
it doesn't like I don't feel like comfortable sometimes, like a lot of times

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000
like

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
I will still say it though be like oh I'm hard of hearing so like

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000
know and sometimes I have to sit down and be like oh you have to slow

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
for me I understand

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:56.000
there's a process. I have to like pick up your tone, that's how I feel.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Yeah. Thank you Shanequa, for sharing your story.
