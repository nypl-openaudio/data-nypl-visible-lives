00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm Diane Campione I'm interviewing today for Visible Lives at the JCC.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Center ?along? special needs fair. Today I'm speaking with... Kathy Nowak

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Hey Kathy, who's story're you telling us about today? My son, Michael.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And can you tell me what made you suspect that Michael was different?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I really didn't because he was very engaged and happy as a young, uh,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
infant and it was only when, at 11 months

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.000
approaching 12

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
12 months that he wasn't meeting his ?small motor? skills

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
?? my pediatrician led me into early intervention and then from there

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Tell me about the day that Michael was diagnosed. Um, it's different, you know

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
alot of times when people talk about what happens when he's diagnosed

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
people assume your child has autism. I mean ?inaudible? 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
?inaudible? um, so it took- it was a long journey. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Very long. Not 'til 11 months old that he

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
diagnosed with an intellectual disability. [See ya, take care] And, um, so the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
classification they gave him was autism? Intellectual disability.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
intellectual disability. How would you describe your emotions after

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
you first heard that dis- that diagnosis. For me it was okay.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
because my ?fears? was

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
classified as. Right. So it was a gradual, and gradually

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and the ?? diagnosis was changing

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
?inaudible?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What, what word best describes the difficult stages of Michael's disability?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Say that again.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
What word would you say best describes the difficult stages of his disability?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
would it be, um

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Anger or, um [yeah]

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
[background talking].

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Well how 'bout let me ask you this. What would you say was the biggest obstacle for him to 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
overcome? I would say the biggest

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
one that continues is, uh, his motor. When he

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
was approaching adolescence his motor

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
abilities changed and where he could sit at three years old with a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
?11 years old?? and at this point at 25

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
he needs assistance eating and he's very ?aware? I mean

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
he, he understands, he's

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
for lack of a better word, high functioning, he has language, he has sense of humor

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
He can tell me "I need help" when his tremors are so bad

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So, I would, I would think ?the motor?.  And

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And do you ever feel as though you gave up your life to give Michael a life?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
No. ?Never? [chuckle]

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Do you or did you ever ask why?  No

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I always said well, why not? Why, why not me?  Like if it's not me

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
then it'd be someone else. So

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
No. Is there something you would like the public to know about

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
individuals with, um, intellectual disabilities?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.000
[Oh]

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:49.000
[background talking] Just to always remember that they are people that have feelings and they understand a lot more than people think

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
be careful what you say because sometimes ?it comes? right back.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Absolutely. Finish this sentence for me. I draw my strength from

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.000
from

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:09.000
[Background noise] ?inaudible? Well.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
