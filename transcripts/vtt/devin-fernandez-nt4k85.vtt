Uh, hi I'm Ed Plumacher and I'm here with the Oral History Project

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and with Devon Fernandez it is Sunday March twenty second [add year]

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and we are conducting this interview at the West Islip Public Library in West Islip, New

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
York and uh I'd just like to welcome you, Devin, and thank you for uh providing us

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
with, uh, with your story and I'm sure a lot of people will benefit from hearing about it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Um, you know I'd just like you to just start off, just tell us a little bit about yourself I know you

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
were born in New York, you were born in the Bronx tell us, you know, who Devin is, what it was like

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
growin up because, um, you know our readers, our listeners will learn that you have Retinitis

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Pigmentosa, but it was late onset for you, so I'm sure you have a lot to tell about

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
how you lived your life as a sighted person without any issues and how you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
transitioned into into blindness.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Thank you, Ed. Um, I'm happy to be here and happy to tell my story.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
My name is is Devin Fernandez  and, uh, I'm 58 years old. I—

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
was, uh, born in the Bronx in, uh, Presbyterian Medical Center. Uh, I lived at

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
at 580 Castle Hill Avenue in the Bronx, uh, to the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
age of fifteen I have, uh, an older sister and two

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
younger sisters and, uh, we all attended Catholic

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
school from, uh, 1st grade to 8th grade and that, uh, was Saint John

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Vianney, also in the Bronx. And, um, it's amazing that

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
as a child — first, second, third grade — I was able to walk away

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
from my apartment building at least a half a mile away

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
with no concerns of anything happening in, uh.. Today, um parents

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
don't walk a block away without, you know, keeping an eye on their children, so times have

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
changed tremendously. And, uh, and during that time I was

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in Catholic school. I was an altar boy so I was very uh heavy into

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
serving Mass and, uh I, I enjoyed that, you know, tremendously

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and actually had aspired to join the priesthood

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
uh, at one point.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And then, uh, um, I guess life changes and decisions, uh

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
change as well. The, uh, as growing up as a kid, as I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
said I had three sisters and, uh, being the only boy gave me some

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
privileges but uh not many. You know

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I did get some special treatment at times but most of the time, the girls got the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
treatm-- you know the better side a the deal. The friends I grew up with all

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
grew up doing the same thing--we used to go down to the park and play basketball,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
play handball. You know, stick ball was one of our good games.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We used to bounce the ball off the barrel, dis?ing balls,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and, uh, you know games like that Ringolevio and Tag

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and and ?Skellzy, which was a checker game, um, these were all games that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
are really very rarely hear about now and um.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
so we you know we grew up pretty, uh, pretty normal, as far as we were concerned, um, and then

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
as we got older, you know, the neighborhood changes and so do the attitudes and

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
sort of my attitude, and sort of my friends, and, uh, my parents saw me going

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
down I guess, a road that they didn't want me to go down, so, um, they

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
had made that decision, obviously, long before I was in trouble

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to move to the Island and, you know, bring some fresh air and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
get us out of the city life. So, uh, we ended up moving out when I was

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
15, uh which was a big change for me. I was just about to go into high school and

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
leaving my friends behind was uh--was hard to say the least. Not only

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that being a new kid on the block, and starting school new,  it was, you know, a  pretty

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
trying experience. So, uh, which worked worked out very

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
well, um, you know I went through high school and when I was in

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
11th grade I met my, uh, my wife and,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
You know it wasn't till ten years later--eight years later--that I asked her to marry me.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
me. But, um, you know, we dated on and off, we went out with

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
other people. We, you know, experienced a normal teenage life

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
out on the Island, uh, going to the drive-ins and hanging out

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and, uh, again times are different than they are now, uh,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
We used to all congregate in this field that I'm at right now, at the library.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
we would be fifty, sixty kids on a given Friday or Saturday, just hanging out here and not causing

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
trouble, but just had no place to go. So this is where we went and uh there's a big

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
field behind us and we all used to be out in the field and, uh, it was pretty

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
nice until, you know, the police would come and chase us out, and we'd go somewhere else, and they'd chase us outta there

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and, you know, this happened every weekend, um, and it was a cycle

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and, uh, but we never really caused any trouble, or or destroyed any, uh,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
any property so um then after that you know we would finish

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
high school, went away to school, um, came back from

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
school, uh, met my uh, not met my wife, had to ask my wife to marry me prior to

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
leaving.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Um, we got married, uh, we started, um, our

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
family, probably nine years later. So we had established a

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
home before starting our family.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We were, uh, we were doing pretty well, and just prior to my

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
son being born I was an electrician and I uh

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
short-circuited, or slipped, into a electric panel which, uh,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
knocked out a 3-story building, and what ended up happening is my

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
screwdriver hit the ground and the hot bus on the panel and it just welded to

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
the panel. But there was a, an arc that, uh, you know,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
welded that panel, that screwdriver to the panel, and the flame from the

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
arc, had, you know, come.. bounced off the panel, about three feet

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
then, which burned my my hands and my face. Uh, it was in

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
September, and my sleeves were rolled up to my elbows so everything that was

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
exposed was totally burnt.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I remember being pushed away from the panel

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
by something or someone, and I hit the ground, I opened my

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
eyes and I couldn't see, and I was like, oh no I can't see and I started

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
to shake and I was, you know, um, obviously upset about what was

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
going on but yet I could still hear the panel exploding in the background, uh, so

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I crawled my way out of the room by memory and when I got out of the

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
room I noticed that the basement door to the, to um,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
the door to the basement which we were working in was open, and I could see the light. I was like,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Thank God, I could see, and then I looked down at my hands and I was, totally fried.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
The skin was peeling off, it was black, uh, it was, uh, a

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
shock and that's, that's exactly what happened, I went right into shock. Um, my hands started shaking,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I was, you know, visibly upset, actually, emotionally upset.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I, uh, followed the light outside and when I got outside there was a

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
parking maid, or a parking lot, I forgot what they call them.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
A parking lot attendant? A parking lot attendant — not an attendant, who

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
hands out the tickets, uh, you know, um, enforcer, an officer... A meter maid

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
A meter maid. There you go.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
So, uh, I climbed out like five or six steps, and as soon as she saw me she

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
sat me on the floor and, uh, at that point, she was, you know, she was trying to comfort me and,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I would, uh... She was questioning me, and in my opinion I was giving all the right

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
answers but they kept questioning and kept asking me the same questions

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
so I was like either stop asking me the questions or, you know, uh cause

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I'm getting tired of giving you the same answer. I would look at my hands and

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
again I was in shock, boom, my hands, my nerves, my my whole nervous system was shot.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Uh, my face felt like it was just an intense sunburn,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
uh, and I hadn't seen my face at this point. So I'm looking at my

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
hands and then all of a sudden I just calm right down, and, as if nothing happened and I

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
talk to the to the meter maid and we uh, you know, she was telling me don't worry,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
ambulances coming it's coming and I was like OK whatever and then or somebody right back into shock again

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and so this happened from what I understand the endless only took about

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
fifteen minutes which which is pretty good. And during

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
this time I was coming in and out I was you know looking around me I was gathering a crowd and

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I looked up from the building that I was working in and you

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
know it was in the actual building I knocked a whole building out people were looking out the

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
window staring at me and you know I just could see my hands and I could see our bed my

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
hands were but I still didn't think it was bad

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
. Excuse me and.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Finally the ambulance come and they wrap me up and take me to the hospital and the

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
whole time in the hospital I'm still like you know OK you know I got to go home I got some to do

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
today this evening after work and without realizing it

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
you know the extent of my injuries. So they stripped me down and

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
again you know on to questions from the doctor with the same questions over and over and

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
over again and then I was really starting to feel the pain from the burns. And I

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
told the doctor I said this is it I see no more questions. I says give me some for the

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
pain and at that point told me that it was going to have to incubate me which was to

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
stick tubes down my throat and I was no way you know doing that I got a good idea

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
today and he's like you know I'm going home. He says I got to do this because if I don't

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
do it now. I may have to do it later when you throw twelve so he goes we don't want to

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
do that so he did that they put me out.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
It turns out I was put into a drug induced coma

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
for three days.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
The drug induced coma for three days and in a coma

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
. You know with my eyes and I would see the nurses working on me and I

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
could see them peeling the skin off my hands and dressing my hands and my hands are

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
suspended up in the air after they were dressing me address the hands

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and my eyes were swelled shut so what I could see was really

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
very very little and then after about three days I was able to

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
see I was able to open my eyes wide enough to see that

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
you know I had sight which you know we're very happy and then I looked at my hands and I was like

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
oh my God what's this.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And then we went through the whole process of what happens as a burn patient and

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
the nurse was like oh you know you don't so good we're going to

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
have to take you for a bath and will you know do your shower will scrub

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
the wounds and we'll put you in another room because I was in critical care at that point

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
so I said OK that sounds great. And then what they did is they put me in the

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
shower but they when they scrape the wounds they draw a skin

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
so I was on fire so you know the host's nervous system

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
shutdown damaged right back into shaking like a leaf and you

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
know so they have said they began.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
But they still put me in another room and they will come in every night and

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
do just that.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
They give me an injection painkiller and then they would literally

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
scrub the skin off the burns

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
the flesh so that it wouldn't scar and when puss wouldn't get infected and I

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
was their main concern of infection because what they did for me and one area in

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
one room they were doing something different to somebody else in another part of the hospital and the

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
live part of the floor because we were all in a burn ward

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and and not to regress but my

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
my wife at the time was eight months pregnant when I when I had this accident. So when she

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
came to the hospital they told her listen if you get upset at all we're going to have to ask you to

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
leave. So they prepared her to you know what I was going to look like

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
and I was like the mommy has to wrap my head was wrapped I mean tubes coming out

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
of my nose it was red blood spots and you know if

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I could only actually I did see pictures of what it did look like so.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
So after that we go into the other ward and what happens is

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I just found a doctor I can't take this you know. This concepts like torture you know the

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
constant cleaning this is don't worry. You know tomorrow you're going to go into surgery and you won't have to worry

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
about the hands we're going to do skin grafts on your hands and fingers in your arms and you know it you

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
know that'll stop us. OK great so I was happy for the surgery and went

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
to surgery and they had told me prior to this that they were going to take the skin from my

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
legs to put on my hands so that they take like a half a layer of skin

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and they attach it to the flesh. It grows back the other half a layer

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and so both has grown and so I get the layer on my skin that was taken off

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
replaces itself and then the new layer that was put on my hands really grows on my on my arms in my

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
hands so I say OK great. So they did that and then I come out of surgery and this is

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
you know all is good I'm in good shape and the nurse says OK now we have to

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
clean the legs we mean the same thing will happen with the hands we got to do

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
with the leg so you don't get affection so I went to the same thing again with I think a

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
cold barring any They come in and they say

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
they give you the so that you know take the edge off and and then they start scrubbing

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and it's almost like an abrasive.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
OK I had that they using and was sailing and they scrub and scrub in to

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
get off the dead skin and in fact not the infection but the gross

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
I guess you know.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So sapien with that is I wasn't healing quick enough so they put

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
me in these hot baths which was salt that which again the my fire

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
you know and so eventually the

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
legs were fine and now I had to wear specially

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
made gloves and I know what is close to two years and

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
I was able to take the gloves off one hour at a twenty four.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
So for two years I would these special gloves. They called job's gloves

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and enormous Tanno skin colored and yes I

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
have probably three four five parities gloves so I can constantly wash and place them

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
and that's what helped keep the compression on the

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
growing skin from bubbling up and scarring in

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and I growing properly so would be N..

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
What we call constant therapy they would clean

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
any sebaceous cyst that I would get they would cut in and drain him and

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
put him in and then we do it again and found we can finally that

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
stopped and I went for therapy for the hands and

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
so it was from I was in the hospital two weeks from my surgery

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and after that two weeks later my son was born my first son was born

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
so I was you know to hold my son for two years you know

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
with my own hands because of the accident.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And so when I landed and was going to low

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
voltage so I was working on high voltage panels I went to

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
low voltage security systems which I had done prior to become an electrician

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and I worked for numerous companies on and off

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and as I you know worked through I started my own

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
business. I would do both you know just to keep it legal I had to have

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
my insurances and everything with my business and then I

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
was a service tech for you know several other organizations and.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I started to notice that when I walk into somebodies house

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
it would be dark and she wouldn't be dark in the room but my eyes thought it

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
was dark and it would take a while to to adjust as al-Qaeda is you know

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
no biggie I just get you know from my to doctor my eyes were having a little issue. Then I

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
walked down from upstairs down to a basement and had been blacked out

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
and take a wallop. Boom came back and then I started noticing

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
the brightness and outside was bothering my light my eyes so

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I decided to go to the doctor and the doctor tells me he says

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
you know you have right now is pigmentosa. Saying OK so

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
that's how he said it as if you know I had a cold or I had floaters in my eyes but he never

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
elaborated on what the condition was what the disease was what the future was and I was like

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
OK so he says I see you next year and we'll see where progress is and I was

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
like OK so I had scar tissue on my retina from that explosion

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.000
.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Oh you know I had trauma to the eye because of that.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Yeah and it was only one doctor who actually made the

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
diagnosis that that's how this started the shock to the to the eyes

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
and the shock to the nervous system triggered it probably a dormant

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
gene that that I had and this is how you know

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
this progressed and how do you know.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
At this point I am forty years old

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
through forty and I just think that forty three years old with the first

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
diagnosis.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
OK Then at forty four I think of going back because the symptoms started

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
to you know to get worse and

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
that's when he told me you know I tell you you have right now is pigmentosa so then

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
that's when I looked it up and I was like oh my goodness I haven't there's a chance that I can actually go

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
blind which I totally didn't believe because my eyesight was still in pretty decent shape at

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
that point I was still driving a car I was still driving at night and I

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000
thought I had really pretty decent vision. And slowly

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000
but surely the system symptoms started to present

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
themselves. First I started losing my depth perception

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
then I start to lose in my ability to adjust

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
between darkness and lightness and I had

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
gone to a doctor and didn't even know I was losing my color vision at the same time thinking

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
OK I can see that I can see then when I went to the doctors clearly

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
clearly clearly evident that I can see I can make out

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
most of the colors and so then I went to a specialist in

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Manhattan New York and he you know he diagnosed so yes you

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
definitely have retinitis pigmentosa and this is a hereditary disease and

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
somewhere along your family line somebody in your family has had this and

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
it tracing back along our family line. We don't have anybody who had blindness and in our

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
family although some people some of our family had eye issues it was never

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
blindness you know that the net wasn't correct corrected with

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
corrective lenses. So the

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
system and symptoms started to progress

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
. I started to limit my

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
driving time where I was you know how I don't know how I was getting back and

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
forth to different areas of you know the island I would make sure

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
that towards the end of the day before it got dark I was making my way home.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And even sometimes in the daylight if I would

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
go from a bright street and turn into a shaded area I'd have to

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
stop and wait to the my eyes adjusted and then

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
continue on you know a neighborhood road which was pretty dangerous

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
. And it scared the hell out of me because I was not

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
concerned most you know the hurt myself but I was really concerned her and somebody else

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
and you know having him say you know you know you had eye problems are you still behind

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
a wheel that's a problem. You know two issue. So

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
again this is another step in that in the change. I went

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
from seeing the road signs a big highway signs to not even

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
seen a road within six months and

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
the progression started to rapidly take its course.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
I got to see other doctors I go to three different specialists and they put me

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
on one of the doctors had described it as it's an

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
auto immune condition where my retina is attacking. I mean

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
my immune system is attacking the retina so auto

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
immune right not to be. So it slowly took bites out of my

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
rent and start with the left eye and then you know

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
manifested itself in the right eye and continued to destroy the retina

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
to the point where I had to stop driving all altogether.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
However I will say that it was my decision and it was

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
a hard decision. Because I remember even making decision not driving at

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
night was a hard decision. You know because now it's time to put the burden of

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
the transportation on to my wife and at the time I don't think she

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
realized to do agree of loss that I had

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
because I certainly didn't and I you know I forced myself to do it as long as I could

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
where I would come home some days and my stomach would be in knots you know just

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
just for the trip home.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
So in your original record for locations.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Yes. Yeah. So bouncing around you know I would I could do one hundred miles in a

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
day from one end of the island to the other

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
and you know as you can imagine it just you know it's so

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
frightening that that had that had to stop so

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
I stopped driving at night. And at that same time

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
I had to give up my my job because it was part of my job I had to

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
deny service emergency service and so that then that's when

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
I forced myself to to go full time in my own. Business

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
which will worked out great because I was able to dictate my own hours

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
and then the issues started to come up when the weather changed. You

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
know I would look forward to a rainy day because I was able to see better in a rainy day

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
or dark cloudy day I was able to see better and then it got to the point where that was

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
you know bother me now I was getting too dark so I couldn't do that then

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
and as the condition progressed I was

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
lose work. I was you know I couldn't you know if

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
you know a goat go to somebodies house and work in their house and

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
not be worried about damaging something or. You know knocking something over

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
that you know was was pretty expensive and you know people see it like

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
I work in an ad as they are too thrilled with that.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
You know Sir George my security. Yeah this guy's right.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
So you know so that that that became an issue

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
So I land of having to stop my installations. Well when I had an insulation I

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
would sub it out or I would do it with somebody else

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
and I make them do the work and I just supervise and tell them what to do which is what I do now but

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
you know like a field he was

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
absolutely absolutely So right now that's how I maintain my business

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
because for the most part every installation that I've done I recall

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
very vividly in my mind.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
I'm what's what and what's where and so forth so when when I do

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
go to somebodies home or business I I actually tell them OK notices

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
over here and as you know it sometimes amaze that really I can't believe you remember that or

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
you know because I did the job so I know where it was. So

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
then the same thing when it comes to programming panels and cameras and so forth

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
I dictate to the person who's helping me with what has to be done

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
and and it's right there in front of them. You know so it's the works are very

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.000
very good

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
. So I had a major impact on the practical side of life. You

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
have an effective motion.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Emotionally I it's a

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
good question because I I can't

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:32.000
answer that because as it went from stage to stage I just dealt with each

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
stage as it as it presented itself not really thinking about the

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
outcome.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
You know so you just going from stage to stage was difficult

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
at times but. Smoove as

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
well you know so and I

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
had already started training in martial arts prior to get my diagnosis

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
so I I decided to train as if I had lost my sight

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
so I would train my eyes closed and I just in a dojo I would do

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
that in the street so I do that looking for something in my garage you know I close

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
my eyes or I do it in the shower. You know looking for the soap and

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
shampoo in a towel and doing things and then when I came up of course something that

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
it did that startled me I opened my eyes and and that's how I train myself

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
with the cane and I was going now into Manhattan and

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
as bump into people in a lot of times it's not a good thing to

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
bump into people because they don't know what your intention is and then you know you can get an

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
attitude from from people thinking that you do and it being aggressive time so

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:53.000
what I would have done is that I got the cane so that people would know I have a visual impairment

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
so this way you know he would usually ducking.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Yeah strictly as communication and a learning device for me

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
for you you know it's no formal training or no formal training it

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
. That's right that's correct

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
. So let us you know say you know you have a world people

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
which is commendable.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
And there's no borders or systems of the key

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
here.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Yeah and I did that I think I can assess it for safety you know

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
because like I said you could walk down the street in New York City bump at somebody and you have an issue now

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
you know which for the most part I never had you know I guess that's just

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
my own interpretation of of people in New York

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:46.000
City you know in the major city anyway. But so

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I started doing that and I you know I was walking down the street with

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
my eyes closed which is scary and then I'm thinking wait a second I don't need to

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
walk downstream eyes close I have sight you know so why am I doing this but at the

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
same time I wanted to learn how to do this without the say so in

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.000
the short run

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.000
. Oh yeah you know it was strange because I was like you use

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
what you got on you know.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
But at the same time I wanted to learn you know what happen if which I

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
still never thought it would happen. And as my

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
vision did decrease and the symptoms were obvious

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
I hooked up with the commission for the blind and this is all done through my family actually my mom

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
researched it and no information from Dr

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
No information off of it from the doctor that this you know and

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
he was just the eye doctor that day. That's on the corner you know that I went to see

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
just because and it wasn't a specialist at this point and then when he saw

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
you guys are going to specialise and they were like oh yeah I need to do these different tests and it would

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
only prove how much I had lost you know which I didn't even know I had lost

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
from from the tests that they did and sometimes I don't want to go to a doctor because I knew that he's

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
going to tell me I was more you know my plan you want to hear that

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
. So I went to the commission and they

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:22.000
actually gave me quite a.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
What he called of quite a few

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
different avenues to go down. They first they went we went down and the

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
technology because I had my business I still had to you know write a bills and

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
estimates and so forth so they they help me with the technology part of it I

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
went of commuting back and forth from Manhattan to Long Island to three days a week

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
for these classes and an hour ago which of introns

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
playhouse I went to Baroque. Yeah I went to college

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
which I did several classes of several workshops or programs with them

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
. I went to the commission. A

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Catholic until Catholic charities as a Catholic Charities in

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Manhattan as well.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000
The Jewish guilt I think that a Jewish guilt Catholic

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Charities in Manhattan put it Catholic charities on the island would come to my

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
house so that there was foreign sources.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Yes you know working for a lot of people. Yeah.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
And those services you know for the most part

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
I.E. since I was cited I you know I had a real good

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
idea how to clean my house you know put things away how to cook and so forth but you know some

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
of the things that they did for me was it was so obvious they were an obvious you know the you

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
know just the safety aspects of cooking and you know that I just never paid

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
attention to because I just took for granted that you know I could see enough to you

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:08.000
know avoid them and they sort of mocking in labeling things

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
told in the washing machine and you know I made it my my

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
keyboard so that you could easily find the you know certain letters.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Which was a tremendous help and then I was using the

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
dark black markers right.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
So a normal pencil normal pens because they consider any moron can see pictures in a

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
newspaper anymore I can see the T.V. I couldn't make out

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
what was actually going on I could see figures moving but you know I couldn't really

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
follow to the shows and then

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
you know again that the commission you know help me to adapt to that technology

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
to technology that I'm using now which is a joyous program and

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Jaws is totally audible whereas I command

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
the keep it in and you know it'll read whatever I'm

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000
asking it to read. We started to zoom tech to check

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
my progression was so quick that tech program just an

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
uber very quickly and it was get me dizzy you know I have to I just so

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
much to see the word Mousehole Screecher the whole movie screen moves with you and

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
say OK this isn't going to work. So I picked up on the joys

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
and that's what I use now and I so I still have issues

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
sometimes with the joys and I think for the most part it's not the issue of the

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
program but the way that the programs are formatted

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
all the websites are formatted. Some of them are just not George friendly road

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
users as you know no matter how you what you do

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
it's just lessen the frustration or patience for however you want

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
to put it and I'll go through that a little bit and then OK that's enough and

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
I shut it down and so at

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
that point I you know I had lost the privilege to drive.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:20.000
I like my job I was losing money and my business

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
I had no income coming in. There was really no you

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
know means of income because you know

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
what I had depended on in the past was no longer available to me and

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
I thought I still have a wife and two boys in school home and two dogs and.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
So you know I started meditating a lot and going in

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
wooden and this is all you know I hope the martial arts training will

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
help in this.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
But pride to martial arts likes to meditate as well because I was taught I was

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
more spiritual and religious kind of person so the

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
meditation come came comes easy and it's comforting and

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000
so I would do it and I would also ask you know what's the

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
purpose of what's going on here. You know you know

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
why am I going through this and I don't want to be why me why me why me.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Because I look at so many other people who have other issues and situations and

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
you know they move forward and and that's what I wanted to do I don't want to be a limey kind of

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
person I wanted to be how can I so

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:39.000
wish

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
. Yeah yeah it was it was

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
reaching deep into into myself to you know to know that you know

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
there's a purpose for my life and the course that you know my life

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
take is taking for me I felt that there was a reason for that.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
You know so I would always ask in my meditations. Well you

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
know what's what's the reason. Who can I help who can I serve

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
you know just give me an answer of you know what to do and

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
so during that I was kind of like well what are the things I can do one of the things I can I

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000
can share is the martial arts because I've

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
been doing it a while knowing more thought

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000
about two years three years prior at

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
that point I was just going into my green belt was you weren't you were not a whacko

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
before you do it.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
No no no no and when I finally got my

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
black belt my vision had

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
decreased quite quite a bit where I was still

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
driving but I was limiting your writing you know.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
And I was still able to see a poncho still it'll see a kick you know as you know

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
it is all good and then out of

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000
a different a different world it almost seems like you know step from one

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
world into another and that you know so. During my meditations I

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
was you know I wanted to continue to work out and I wanted to

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
find a place that other blind people work so I can you know relate to them and we

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.000
started doing some research and they were finding places and the nearest place was

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
in Manhattan and Saito which is a crowded studio there

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
was a place that's on Twenty third Street between six and

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000
seven and they offer a program for the Blind which is you know fantastic program

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
and I I started going there and I was

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
I was like this is you know it's too far to travel just to come and work

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000
out. So I started to talk to my mind start

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000
there and I mentioned to him you know I want to start a program actually spoke of my so my sister

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
who's co-founded a program and so is Tom you know I have

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
to do something you know. But I just don't know why she is or why don't

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
we develop a program and you know that's a great idea.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
We we started to do first things first we had to get a place to hold

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
it so I spoken to my instructor and I told him that you know I wanted to do this

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
and he goes that's fantastic because why don't you do it here. I says well that's great but I want to

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
be able to do it for free. So he was like OK well then

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
do you still do it here you know so he and he has been our biggest supporter

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
you know from day one and we're going on five years now. We started in two thousand and ten

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
and you know May fifteenth May two thousand and fifteen will be five years

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
and so here again he's been a tremendous supporter and we went to

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
see you know who can we get to come to these organising classes and we

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
went to different organizations and outreach to you know

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
how do you form your organization officially at this point was still an idea. OK

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
So you know we wanted to know if there was going to be a market now that you know marketing the

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.000
interest rate you know and it is a

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
great interest however. Things

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
that affect the blind such as transportation are an issue and

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
timing and what have you.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
So once we establish that yes we can do this and we hope that when

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
I die in Freeport road was one of the first people we

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:01.000
spoke with investors to support their work record and so

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
we spoke with them and then I when I spoke with a group Helen Keller

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
out in Huntington at the time

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
I went and reached out to other groups of reach out to the veterans and

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
we will start to roll and the next thing we limit having to do

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
was to stop talking about it and set a date which we did and we promoted it and

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
we had a tremendous turnout. Initially and.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
You know and we had expected to get a decent turnout and we also had expected some

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
people say this is great to says that's so good you know I like the program but it's

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
not for me. But with that with that we're learning

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000
that part of it that's what can this mean

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
to him to doing other things other than a martial arts program initially was

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
going to be martial arts yoga and meditation which is what we do on a on a

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
weekly basis now in which the program or other it's just the name of the program

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
is third eye insight and that also came to my meditation

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
because that's how I used to meditate through the third eye which is located at the center of the

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
forehead and I always open my third eye and step into and you know

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
it's my place of rest and peace and tranquility.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
So we started the program and then you

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
know we realize that not everybody is into martial arts not everybody's into the punching and

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
kicking which is totally understandable.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
So we started to incorporate some of the outside events or recreational events

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
swimming in swimming swimming was in the in in our thoughts what hadn't been

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
you know political that we hadn't set up a

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
class or for that or a program for that and so we

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000
go horseback riding we went kayaking for the first year then went

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
skiing then we we went

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
fishing pole all the different things that would do bull

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000
and all these huge algae archery and we did

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
an archery program we did you know throwing knives and you know stuff

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
that I felt that interest me and would interest others you know

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
pretty outdoorsy guy I like to be active I like to do different things and and I

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
want to bring out you know about and around so others can experience the

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
same pleasures and then as the network started to grow

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
you know we met with you Ed And you do that

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.000
water skiing and you know snow tubing you just

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
you know you just went on I was also on your program. The

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
program which was at the time and my money

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
was very helpful and you know we find out

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
we'll with a lot because all students get together you know we will have similar

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
conditions but some of the factors are going on in our lives all

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:32.000
because of a tremendous you know and we will you know

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
and we're lucky because in our group were able to talk freely and not be

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000
offensive and joke around and people would be like oh yeah I did that too you know

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
I can't believe you know that you know so something that you may not share with somebody to say because they

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
may not understand it.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
You know somebody in the black community finds a humorous you know oh that was funny because I did the

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000
same thing you know you know it was going to your program to use against

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
people who are sitting home.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Feelings are themselves human life is over all it was person by

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
is an opportunity not to come out and share experiences and share

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
opportunities to do that. Yeah meet new friends I mean you know there's a whole

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000
community has developed of you know through your your brother and friend

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
. Yeah they're so into really now.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Yeah yeah and you know and the thing is you never know who you touch

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000
or how that person's touched you know so

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
those are some of the definite positives you know which is which I like to

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
bring out and everything you know and

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
even just the way you speak about yourself it needs to be in a positive you know I

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
can't do that you know that's not positive you know positive How can I do that

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
you know let me know I get can I try I don't you know I want to do that you know

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
and it is events that I want to do that the

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
community won't let us

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
. Yeah you know you guys are crazy can do that. So now we can I can I can

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
relate can but they won't so we had educate them you know a

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
little bit more for me

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
. So you know the group has grown we've you know

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000
life is changed.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
My children have grown and you know so

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
this is been probably.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
I'm guessing so far so probably almost

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
. Jeez thirteen years now I think

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
since I known about it too

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
. I am today and and where I am today is that I'm almost totally

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
blind right you know we live in such an earth I have light perception

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.000
I can see sometimes contrast black and white everything is black and white

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
so it could be red and white it can read like a science I can see red sometimes

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
and yellow as well I think I do but like white on

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
black black on white. You know which works out good because he's a black so I can see

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
the silhouettes of people.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
But I'd lend it having to go for a seeing eye dog and I got my

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
first dog about a year and a half ago and again is at it as a

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
necessity to stay active and you know I was seeing

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000
changes in one of the things I noticed Journ my progression

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000
through this condition is that I would go to the same and I go

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
for music lessons because that's what I was doing. I would go into the city for music lessons take a

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000
semester have a week off two weeks or three weeks off come back and

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000
things I was able to see two three weeks ago were different. So so that's an

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
obvious change. You know where I didn't notice that change because it was so

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
gradual and you always were like you want to do

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
you know that was something I wanted to do I was on my To Do List

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000
bucket list yeah I always wanted to be a black belt and I

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000
always wanted to play saxophone. So

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.000
I decided you know the opportunity came up at the lighthouse. I found out about that program actually there was

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
a program in visions in Manhattan on Twenty third Street

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000
as well. But they didn't they offer drumming drumming and guitar right which

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
I wasn't interested in either.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000
But I was interested in learning a Saxon when I found out about the lighthouse as I well you know and we let

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.000
me check it out in for the first time I walked into you

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
know first class I was loving it and the teacher that I had was fantastic because

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
he was teaching a blind student and you know

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
and he knew that and that's how he taught that's how he prepared his classes so I would

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
record every lesson and go home practice so I rented a

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000
sax for the first couple years and until I purchased my own

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000
and then I go home and practice every time with the sacks and it was it was

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000
you know it's really good and he's kept me interested in it till today you know which is

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000
you know it is it is amazing for me because a lot of times

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
you know I'll pick it up and I'll do it for was OK that's enough and you know put it down or go through spurts

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
or on whims or whatever you want to call them but if I would take

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:45.000
the summer off because there's no summer class and go back the next semester in

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
September is a big change and that's when I really started to notice oh

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000
man this thing is changing pretty quickly you know. So

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
again another adjustment and that's when I realized I needed to dog and stop doing any of those

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
things so I got a dog went for the training at Smithtown Guide Dog

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Foundation in town New York and you know

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
from there it's it's been it was too

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.000
. I felt uncomfortable with the dog where I was more consulate my

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
cane and because I was so used to stick and I was so used to my routine and

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:28.000
everything I could still do without a dog but a yard dog made it so much easier and

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000
now it's the opposite now. I want a dog right. You know just

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
just it's incredible feeling when she navigates me

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000
through a crowd of people you know and he would tell where to go

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.000
and it's been a couple times in Penn Station where I'll get off the

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:52.000
train come up an exit where I'm not even familiar with that because you know I can't see

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
it anymore and I say OK go find it let's go and Bush takes his right where you got to go

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000
and it really is a socal.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000
And so sometimes I walk that walk contestation a smile on my face you know

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000
because she's just navigating me in and out in and you know she takes in Iran

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000
it's being you know so. How do you find your tree leaving

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000
no consolation because I remember you know the routine the school

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
I still do that I still do that and the reason I do that is because

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000
it makes my life easier and you know I just go up there and it will go to assist.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
So I'll take it but I'm not afraid to help. In fact you know I

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
think that that's a big thing you know when you need help to get it right you know

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000
if somebody offers you help and sometimes I needn't take it anyway but you know because

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000
personally I have a way they asked me if they want to help me you know as I said OK sure no problem you know

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000
we were killed people all over hell the worst thing you can do you know

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
you're broken.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000
If you know it's our job to educate us or radio where

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000
you know the you know some people read before this before they actually

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
you know you know how long they don't know where you can write without them or anybody else

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
That's exactly right and you know the biggest pot I find is that people don't pay attention

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000
so you know I bump into people and it's not because of me but it's not because of the

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:30.000
dogs because they're not paying attention and you know others are texting and texting

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000
and you know they got their head up in the air and I think I mean things are going to do but

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000
but you know when somebody offers me help I usually will say showing that you know

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.000
unless there's an you know a reason why it's just and there's been days we ask no I don't need your help

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:50.000
and you know where do I look like I need to help you know but

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.000
you know for the most part if if especially in New York City if you stand on a corner long and two

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:01.000
traffic lights somebody says can you do you need help you know and they say one out of

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:06.000
six hundred people will offer you help but your course and want to six hundred people on a

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000
couple blocks.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Yeah I don't like the numbers of homes but there are

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:15.000
people people people are very helpful here.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Yeah yeah I've always I've never had a problem either you know.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000
I've never had anybody give me wrong directions because for the most part I know where I'm going and I just need to

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.000
get oriented to where I am because that happened has happened

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Yes So the progression has been long and slow and

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.000
and it is what it is and I you know I go for

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000
checkups and my doctors and is in Columbia

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Columbia University Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.000
he is does a stem cell research and gene therapy and

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
you know it's like five six years ago he says don't worry ten years from now we're going to have something do you

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000
know. So I truly believe that before

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000
my end of my life I'll have my vision back. OK So

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000
one way or the other you know whether that's through God's intervention

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:22.000
or it's through medical intervention which to me is the same thing you know it's got to come

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
from somewhere. So I truly believe in you know

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000
the way technology is going it's it's inevitable you

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
know whether it's full vision partial vision.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:42.000
An adaptive vision you know with the glasses and the chip in the in the retina.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:46.000
You know any of those modalities any of those you know

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:53.000
devices you know but we're not like

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:58.000
a year or so ago I was you know seen changes of course

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.000
but from where I am now I would take a year and a half ago Division I had a year and a half

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
ago and love it and you know I said OK you know it's much better than I had you know I got now

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000
but you know and it's kind of amazing the things

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
you take for granted and you see you don't see or you pay attention to you

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000
don't pay attention to you know and then when you kind of lose that

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:28.000
you can appreciate what you had but now it's already too late you know.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:34.000
I'm appreciating what you have now is really you know you could do

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:39.000
you know so that's kind of the my day after day one day at a time you know

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.000
this is this is this is this today it is going to be a good day today and you know and usually it is you know those

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:50.000
obstacles happen you know things come across a table that you know you don't want to but they

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000
and they come and they go you know so yeah that's

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000
that's that's how I take it you know you know.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Unfortunately nobody can for about four years now and so yes you know a

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:08.000
dramatic decrease in your vision in the past couple years but I've

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000
never known you have never heard the story before about your ass and a

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
bunch of claims are. Down. That was pretty

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:18.000
rough.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Yeah you know and you were one of those is a tough thing I

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000
mean how much I want to be a huge accident give you the

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000
strength to get through but you know you know you know it

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000
was it is it's.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000
It's hard to say because when I first when the explosion first happened

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.000
and I was blind I was like I was in shock I was you know and I shock physical shock but

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:51.000
fear fear you know fear is more of like you know God I can see oh my God I can

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:56.000
see and that was traumatic you know that was really

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.000
really pretty I wakening eye opening

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:05.000
it you know but then when I saw him say oh good I can see.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:10.000
So but even from that same day from that day or from

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000
when I was able to open my eyes again I always felt that there was something wrong

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000
with my eyes you know and I didn't want to

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.000
verbal to say it you know because I don't want to you know bring him out as they say manifest

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.000
something that's not there. You know but you know it just happened it just was

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.000
there it was it was obvious it was you know something that was becoming unavoidable.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000
You know I just couldn't ignore it you know and so on.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000
But that's you know that's that's that's the story and that's that

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.000
that's the path you know went today.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.000
We Like I said we have a beautiful program we have a lot of people joining our

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000
program and your family your universe supported the program

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000
. Yeah

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
yeah absolutely.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Absolutely and you know one of the other things was is that I wanted to be an

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.000
example for my boys you know because you can't give up if you give up. What are

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:18.000
they going to say when life gets tough you know. So it's

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000
it's that kind of a catch twenty two and you know you you want to be feisty you want to give

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.000
I mean I want to say you know I'm not dealing with this you know. But you got to do

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.000
it and the way you deal with it is you know is it kind of like an example to

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.000
everybody else you know you know that responsibility punky you know strength

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000
is you know if you wanted on absolutely you

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000
absolutely certainly was because you know again like I said I needed to be an

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000
example. I was pushed into that you know what as a

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000
father an example anyway.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.000
You know so people don't vote that it was not

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.000
an issue but you know you want to say I want to do the right thing I wanted to you know.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000
Because you know we all know that there are going to be difficult times in

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000
life. So you know how you deal with them you know

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000
and how you look at them and you know it is really your choice you know you

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.000
choose to look at it in a certain way I choose to look at it

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.000
in you know the way I look at it I choose to look at it in a positive way regardless of what it is

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.000
even you know people say like if you look at a positive way there's always something that comes out of that

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:42.000
you know and and this is a positive you know why I will lose my vision and now I have a

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.000
program for blind people you know if you've got scores of well you know

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000
I like to think that and I almost think that that's not true

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000
because they were looking to be out there looking for something it's not that you know

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:02.000
you know or something miraculous that they can do for themselves you know they were looking for things to

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.000
do there and and even now once I join this community I've seen.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Opportunities open up for the blind and I don't think we're there before you know

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000
because now more blind people are becoming aware that they don't have to sit home. You know I'm not

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:22.000
just a number that you know it's on the

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.000
disability list you know. So you

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:31.000
know we have people now involved in every day of their

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000
lives you know the transportation you know the people who

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:41.000
are looking to sign up voters and you know to get our voice

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000
heard and so what do you want your students really

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.000
who say oh yeah go from here in New York City

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Marathon

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.000
. I met her for the first time your program is not very

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000
physical and to me.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Yeah yeah yeah she wouldn't go out without a dad and you know and she started taking the bus

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000
by herself and you know she went for independent living and you know there's an example of

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:14.000
somebody who was booked for something wanted and growing and you know and that's

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:14.000
what.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Well I think it's really OK I understand what you're trying to save

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
your catalyst. Well I appreciate that you thought a lot of people

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.000
get from point A to point they continue on it which is

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
yeah I don't.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
So when you meditate now you know a new

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
piece I mean seeing the program being more people of a community

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
to be interactive with you know does that help you feel

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:47.000
better.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
It actually does.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
I'm a big believer in visualizing what you

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
want you know for instance I am looking

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
to have my own facility and I really know what it looks like I've been

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
there I've walked through the doors you know I have it laid out in my head I know to

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.000
call and say no you know how everything I so I know what I feel that I know is there

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
inferentially it will be you know.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Yes So when I meditate I do visualize on that and I

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
also just fish and I was just trying to be calm you know

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
because as you know stress in life you know even as

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
positive as you want to be there is always something that comes up that you know kind of tweaks you and you could be the

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
easy stuff that you did when you decided you know I miss my boss you know running away

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000
now I'm going to miss my bus or you know whatever the situation is

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000
. Yeah you know how many times I have you know

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000
I I still hold a lawn and last season I was

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
mono law and I shut it off I emptied the bag and I can find a lot more.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
I say son of a gun.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I know I had a little color my life with a launch is what happened as I walked

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
away from it but I

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:13.000
lost. You know the funny things

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000
and some of them you know we can share and laugh at it and you know and we choose

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.000
life that you know or if we bump into something I always laugh and say OK somebody out there is laughing

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000
you know like OK watch this washes he's going to he's going to papa said you know there it is it's

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
OK It was fun hearing you know I mean one of them

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:33.000
two years ago.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Less two years ago this summer when you got you got it all you know to summer with her and

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.000
yet reclamation period together you're depending on it is going well I guess the fall comes and you

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000
go back to the White House for saxophone lessons right.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
She doesn't like it. Yeah that's exactly right exactly right

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000
. So we we had to do some training for her here you

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
know to get used to it and you know the people I think I don't they sure are great about it

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
you know let's try this. We procure uneasy and poking a little easier and

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
because you know you got to get the dog in and escape you know so I did and she did you

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
know says I saw she was gone you know and then it allows us to realize OK

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
So Betty still play nobody got hurt and she would come and sit next to me you know and then she got to

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
the point where it wasn't all that hard all you know and now I go into the city I'd walk into the room she knows

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
where to go to go she rolls up and she says that she weighs you know until it's all really

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
so you know she got used to it.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Yeah. Yeah right I was can take that either way right. So that's the

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
counselor the trainer said Nicholson I said well maybe Sean like my

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
music you know is going to practice more or

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
less programs that were already programmed in doing there as well.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
That's right that's right.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Which is a great program and is another point you know we partnered with the Y.M.C.A.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
and they have reached and you know we were able to put together this program on a weekly

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000
basis and you know they do for us and and we have

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
people who need that you know all elderly or you know

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
physically out of shape and they need it.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Easy exercise you know it was great it was time you provide

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
classes you provide that program and you know that's awfully early right.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Yeah yeah yeah. Everything so far is free you know we we work on a

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
shoestring budget and because my instructor allows us to use his

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
his facility has a huge expense that we don't have to incur. Right.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.000
And you know so that right off the bat is tremendous

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:50.000
and we love organizations that help serve the disabled community

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
. You know all these events that we do are are centered around the disabled

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
so when we go surfing these guys are training us to say if

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
you know how to work around a disabled you know even when you go to

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:09.000
skiing you know they were rigged for disable the program.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Yeah you know when we go skiing you know you get three guys come follow you down the hill

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
you know and they make it seem and feel like it's so comfortable that you're not afraid to

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.000
take some of the fear out of it and you know there's always the apprehension but remove the fear

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000
and and that's the big thing and when people start doing that and they start realizing I am I

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
can't believe I did that you know I can feel that you know it's such an

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000
uplifting exhilarating feeling that you know they can't wait to do something that you know the next

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
thing you know. But also the other half is getting the word out and

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
telling people and getting more people involved you know because this still. I don't even

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
believe we have one percent of the population

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
. Oh OK So you know some people get a refund of about thirty

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
. Well we've we've got a few things you know we have a website

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
. I also have a public access station that

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
we we we have a show that will probably broadcast every

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Tuesday and it's self defense

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
but it also deals with topics that involve the visually impaired

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
radio knows on Cablevision channel twenty. Oh and if you have

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
optimal park we'll have it soon as well.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000
You can you can see in our planet Mike my first

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
episode was with my instructor. OK second episode was with me in

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
another one of my instructors. Third episode we shot actually here at the library

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000
third or fourth episode we shot here which is a nutritional episode

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
and the power of visualization.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Wow So so all this is on the west side as well yeah and that

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
is the you know you know you dub third eye insight

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000
or Yeah and they're going to teach irony that's the way you write. Yes inside

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
. OK.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
A.N.S.I. G.H.T. and people you know you through contacting you have

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000
info at third eye and saying you can email me and reach out to me and

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
we also have a page there that forces for good and so so many other organizations that

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.000
are associated with or associated with the black community and so it's quite

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000
quite informative and I mean you know

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
the Cablevision enough awesome

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000
. Yeah yeah well you know

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:48.000
appreciating the time and he was vital information in the next three years.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000
You've come a long way. Yeah yeah. You've run the gauntlet.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Yeah you know like I said it's almost seems like it's different worlds you know

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.000
side it will to the blind world it almost seems like two different people you know from where I

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:06.000
was to where I am a well you know the whole change and what

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
we call a metamorphosis

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:13.000
. More recently you know we are very happy with us as we count

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:13.000
.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000
It's like ass yeah I say you can sleep sleep at night. Well

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:18.000
thank you.
