00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Good morning, my name is Diane Campione and I am here with Rita Cedar.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
at Lifestyles Recording for Visible Lives. Good morning, Rita! Good morning.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Tell me a little bit about yourself: Where are you from? Um, originally?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Yes. I'm from Long Island, and uhh, now I live on Staten Island.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Okay, and I want you to tell me: What makes you different from other

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
individuals?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Well, I have the walker, but I don't feel that I'm different.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Do you um mind if I ask you what your disability is?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I can't walk well, I need a walker for support. And, umm...

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
you live at home? Do you live at home? I live in an apartment house.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Is there a service personnel or a device besides the walker that you use to make it more

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
adaptable or more accessible for yourself? I use a cane

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
or the walker, preferably the walker. And that makes navigating things

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
easier for you? Much easier. OK. I want you to tell me a little bit

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
about who you are. What type of person do you think you are?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Kind, generous, uh aggressive...

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
um, strong? I think I'm a strong person.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And would you say that is... would you consider your life difficult?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Because of the walker, it

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
it is difficult, but I I

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
know I do things that I'm capable of doing. What makes things

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
difficult for you? What type of things? Shopping. I have, I can put things.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
In a bag on my walker, on the side of it. Going places,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
working stairs is very different.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Do you find that most um industry or most

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
when you go shopping, are they, is there accessibility for you within those places? Do you feel that's

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
something that's lacking? When I'm shopping? No, I don't. I sit

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
on the walker, right on line. Okay, and can you tell me who

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
has been the most important person in your life? Could be

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
somebody from way long ago or current.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I think going to Manor Road is the most important thing.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I've made friends here. And when I was in the hospital,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
my friends visited me all the time. I have no family here. I live alone.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.000
[background noise]

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
When you see Manor Road, you mean the JCC? The JCC, yes. Oh, that's wonderful, so is it a social group?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's a social group and we go out together, we have lunch together every

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
day. And

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And what doâ€”Right here. Right here, at this Manor Road. And what would you say is the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the, one of the most important things about having social groups?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Can you give me a specific about what you think is, what you think is more beneficial about having these

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
groups?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I know that if I fell, somebody would be there. If I needed help,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
they would help me. They did in the past. That's wonderful.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I have a, umm, famous quote that I've been asking people: the

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be. What kind of a

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
person do you think you've decided to be? The one that can take care of

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
myself. A friendly person, and a giving person. That's wonderful.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Can you finish the sentence for me: I draw my strength from

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
God. And I'd like to ask you finally: what

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
would you like to tell people? What would you like people to

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
know about individuals such as yourself, that use um a

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
wheelchair or a walker or a cane to navigate their

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
surroundings. What message would you like them to know? Just do it and get out. There are means,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
People will help you. I know now people open the door and I say oh I'm just

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
using this because I want you to open the door. That's not true.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
People are very kind, I've noticed. You found it? I think they're always fine but

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I think they're kinder. That's good! That's very good. They're very polite.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
[background noise]

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
The door's open. It's an extra early of an obstacle I'm curious

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
to know if there is anything that you would like changed in

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
society. For um how we as individuals should

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
be helping people like you. Is

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Is there anything else? Realize that they could be next in line. It could happen to them, just like

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
it happened to me. That's very interesting. So say for today I'm gonna

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
be able to work. And then all of a sudden I couldn't.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Well. Thank you so much for sharing your story really well just lovely nice meeting you.
