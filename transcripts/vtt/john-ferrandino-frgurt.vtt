00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Good morning I am here with John Ferrandino. I'm recording the visible

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
lives. John I'd like to ask you a few questions about yourself. Can you tell me

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
what makes you different from other individuals? Well I have like

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
a learning disability like I have a tough time remembering things sometimes but I'm starting

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to get the hang of things, I'm 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Getting better at it so. Does your disability have a classification what were

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you classified as? What do you mean? Like. Learning disabled? Asperger?. What is your actual

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
classification for disability? Well I'm. Like I don't really have.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I have a disability but I function on those things. Well so.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Basically I. And where you from, are you from Staten Island? Well I was born

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in Brooklyn, Somewhat but I moved to Staten Island when I was three.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And do you live at home? Yes.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Do you have any type of service or any

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
equipment or anything? What makes you able to function every day? Do you have a special computer

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
program or anything like that? I go to a day program at HRC. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
One of my favorites. And can you tell me what you like about yourself?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Well

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm always nice, have a lot of friends and I'm always nice to people

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
help them out, whatever they needed. That's 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
wonderful, and is there anything you dislike about yourself? No. Great.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Do you consider your life difficult, John?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Somewhat, I have ups and downs in life but I get through them. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 and everyday

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So. What are the things that make it difficult?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Things. Day to day. So give me a typical example of what would make a difficult

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
day for you. So if I had like

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Like. Like for example if I have a tough time learning things I get through it

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
somewhat, it takes me time to get to know somebody so and then after a week when I get

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to know them I get better at it. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Can you tell me who has been the most important person in your life?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It could be anybody?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Yeah, anybody. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I would have to say my longtime girlfriend Nina. Uhm I've

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
been with her for seven years and, she's always helped me in my life. We

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
hardly ever fight that much. She's very sweet and, uhm I'm looking to

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
hopefully like propose to her probably by the summer because I'm starting  

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
my job in a couple weeks, so I'm hoping to buy her a ring

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
by the end of, by the end of the summer time hopefully to 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
ask her to marry me so to speak. Thats wonderful, good luck with that. Can you tell me what

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
important lesson Nina has taught you? Specifically? What

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
lessons you've learned from Nina? Well,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
She's always nice and always...

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So she's... her personality, she has a up... up, her personality is

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
contagious? Yes. It helps you? OK. I have a saying from a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
famous poet. The only person you are destined to become is the person you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
decide to be. Can you tell me what person you, John decided to be?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Uhm, I decided to be

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
a nice person,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and like calm in situations,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and always work hard for myself. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So. Thats awesome. I'd like you to finish this sentence. I draw my strength

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
from... What makes you strong?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Family and friends. Great answer.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Tell me lastly what would you like people to know about individuals like yourself?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
That are diagnosed with learning disorders or uhm

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
same type of developmental issues that you have. What would you like people to learn?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Well, like

Like peoples to learn that uhm, what do you mean like? 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Well, for instance what lesson would you like society to know about

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
individuals like yourself that attend day [re]hab programs, that struggle with a disability,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Uhm what lesson is there? For them so to speak?
