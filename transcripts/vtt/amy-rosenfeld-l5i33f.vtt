Hello, my name is Lynn Loxton and I am going to have a

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
conversation with Amy Rosenfeld for Visible Lives,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
An Oral History Project at the New York Public Library. It is

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Tuesday, March the 10th, 2015

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and this is being recorded at the J.C.C. in New York City.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Welcome Amy, thank you for agreeing to be interviewed. We look forward to hearing your story.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Thank you.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I, um, have had a disability my whole

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
life. I was born with an [itis called ??]

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
which, kind of, sort of, affects your vision. It just, kind of, you're born with it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You can't see it.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And as a child I was diagnosed with dyslexia.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Um, but,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But, I'd like to say that

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I don't like it when people say, "Oh, you have a disability." I

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
don't want to be, um, viewed as somebody who can't do things in society.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Um, everybody, um, needs help. It's OK to get

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
help, but I feel like, um, I wanna use

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
my strengths. Um, And

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
though I know I have some weaknesses, but everybody in life has weaknesses. Nobody's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
perfect, um, which I'm glad about. But I'd like to say

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that, um, you know, I have my health, but I think

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that, um, it's very important

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
just, um, like for instance, I have a brother on the West Coast

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Coast and, uh,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I'm, I'm trying and hoping that he will just

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
just learn to love me for, uh, who I am, not teach me

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
not be my mentor, not lecture me, but just learn to love me

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
love me. Um, and so I wrote a little piece

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
for [??] adaptations and I write and so I'm going to read it.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Um,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It's called "How to Just Love Your Sibling With Special Needs." If

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
you're a sibling who has a brother or sister with special needs, just love them. Chances are

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
are they already get enough help, so just love and do not try to lecture

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
lecture or teach them. What a sibling can do to love

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
their older or younger sibling with special needs. Accept them for who

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
they are. Do not talk down to them. Do not lecture your

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
your brother or sister. You do not have to be their teacher either.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Spend quality time with them. Go to a museum. Go on a walk or just for coffee.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
coffee. Hug your sibling. Sometimes that feels nice, too.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Part of loving your sibling with special needs includes encouraging him or her, and not

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
being too critical of everything they do.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Because as a child with special needs, one is put down and criticized too much over their

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
lives. Provide some positive compliments and statements to your sibling

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
with special needs. Just show them love, a nice note or letter.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Finding out how they are and just to say you love them and are thinking about them.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
them. Hug your sibling now and then, just to ask, "How are you?"

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Show some compassion and empathy. Just love your sibling,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
sibling. No teaching or lecturing. Let your sibling with

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
special needs shine. Give them their independence,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
but be there for them if they need you. Um,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And that's true for anybody who has any kind of

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
a disability. That's true for anybody out there. Uh,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
you know, chances are, that person with special needs gets enough help.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So family and friends should just abide by what I read.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And, and, I really feel like

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
society looks down too much on people with disabilities.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Not all disabilities can be seen.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I hurt my foot five years ago. So for me,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
me it's hard to stand on the bus, so I ask for a seat,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and sometimes I ask the bus driver for the lift if it's

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
an older bus, and they look at me and they say "You don't have

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
a wheelchair. You don't have crutches," and I go, "But

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I'm not good with stairs and I need the lift." And they

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
say, "Oh but you don't have a wheelchair," and I

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
say, "But I need the lift." And then sometimes I ask for the ramp.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Some bus drivers don't want to put out their ramp either.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I always get off on the newer buses in the front of the bus because it's lower down.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Um, I don't use subways,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
um, a few too many stairs for me.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I feel safer above ground right now.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Um. At some point that might change.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I'm not sure. Um, and I 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
I'd just like to say, though, that here at the J.C.C.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
everyone's accepted for who they are. I'm accepted for who I am

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
in my workplace and also in the building and all the

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
programs I go to.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
It's not, "Oh you have a disability. You can't work here. You have a

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
disability." If you're not seen as a person with a disability.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And, but, there are programs for people with special needs, which I'm part of,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Adaptations, um, and I go to a lot of their programs,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Um, And it's a good support. It's a very, very good

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
good support. And I've managed to find my own

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
own help. It's my own resources,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and I feel very good about that. But I really, really honestly feel

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
like, um, some

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
disabilities are visible and some are not. And mine is not visible.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Um. So I think it's important that society be

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
aware of that. Um, you know, sometimes I'm slower on

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
stairs, sometimes I'm slower to get off the bus, um, but I

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
I do it. That's the important thing, is that I do it. And

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I just feel like people need to be aware, um, about people with

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
disabilities and not, um, and just realize that

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
everybody has a full potential in society and

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
everybody, um, just tries their best

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and, ah, they shouldn't be, ah, denied a job because of a

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
disability. Um, they shouldn't be denied housing

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
or uh medical care because of a disability. Everybody has the same rights.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Um, and if this is one thing that comes from this interview, that's very

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
very important. Is it everybody?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
We have the same rights and to be given a chance in society at what they want to do.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
do. Um, I'm sure there are doctors out there with disabilities. Um, I'm sure there are surgeons

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
out there with disabilities. Um, I'm sure there are teachers and

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
lawyers, um, with disabilities. Society

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
is a good mix of everyone and we need to keep that in mind.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And I hope that this is helpful. So

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
I think I've said my share and I hope I've made a good impression.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
You've done remarkably well. Could you just tell us a little more

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
about what the Adaptations program does here at J.C.C.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
because this is going to be archived and in years to come people

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
may want to look back and see what some of the kinds of programs are because

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
this is such an enormous community resource itself.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Great, sure, [yes] my pleasure. Um, Adaptations here at the J.C.C. of Manhattan

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
is a program for people in, um, their 20s and 30s and beyond.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Um, It's a program that offers a different kind

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
kind of groups. Um, I go to a drama group one night a

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
week where we talk, where we do improv and we do acting

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
about our feelings and we, um, in the beginning of drama group we

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
always express ourselves, um, by going around the circle with a sound and a movement about how

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
we're feeling. Um, lit club. Um, we

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
write creatively and the piece I've read about how to just love a sibling with special

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
needs, um, came

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
came to me just because of, you know, what's going on, [sure] you know, with my family and

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
also just to make a statement because I think a lot of people just feel that way in general.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Um, So we write creatively and then we share, or, we, people who want to share can

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
share, and people who don't feel like sharing don't need to share.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Um,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
There's a whole, there's an art group that meets. There is a

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
a, um, ah,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
a game night, a movie night. So you can sign up for what you want to sign up for.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
for. Um, a lot, a lot of times after the groups we go

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
out for a bite to eat so we make connections outside of groups. Lot of the times we meet up and go to

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
movies. Um,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
There's a whole, whole

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
list of activities that goes on and on. Um, I go to,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
there's lounge on Sundays, in the afternoon there's lounge where you can hang out and

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
pictures and write games and make friends and learn how to interact.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And learn social skills. Um, actually the drama group used to be

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
called Creative Alternatives of New York, and this year it's Creative

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
called Creative Alternatives to Social Learning, [good] so we do drama around

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
social skills, um, that will help us in society.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
We did a whole thing on family and friendships and dating

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
now we're going to be talking about boundaries [m hm] um, and who knows

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
where that will lead to. Um, and there's another group that I'm part of.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
It is called Y.A.I. The Young Adult adult

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Institute for people with disabilities. That's in Midtown on 34th

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Street. And I go to a good group called Hankering for More. It

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
meets once a month, depending on what group you're in.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
About once a month or once every five weeks. And you, there's

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
usually a lunch involved with a trip.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Um, to a museum, so you either do a museum and lunch and lunch and a museum.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Movie and lunch. Sometimes you meet at Y.A.I.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and um, there was once a meditation and yoga

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
event. And the people who lead the Y.A.I.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
program got me, um, hooked up with their gallery and

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I'm an artist and I express myself a lot through art. Um,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I've been studying at the Art Students League for 15 years and I call it

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
art therapy. It relaxes me. I love it.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And it's my other passion.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I tend,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
So, they got me, the Hankering for More people hooked me up with the gallery

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and we exhibit, and we sell our work sometimes,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And there's a big fundraiser this week. But anyway, it feels so

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
so good for an artist to sell their work.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And as a gallery, the artists get back sixty percent of the

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
sale price. Uh,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
It's not a million dollars, it's not in the Louvre or the MOMA, but it's a very,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
very good feeling, and it gives you a sense of

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
self-worth, as does having a job in society. It gives you a sense

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
of self worth. Um, and it makes you feel

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
"Hey, I'm an Artist. I'm not in a museum

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
but I sold and I sold a few pieces." And I think

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
to end, I'm gonna re-read "How to love a sibling with special needs."

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
What a sibling can do to love their

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
older or younger sibling with special needs: accept them for who they

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
are. Do not talk down to them. Do not lecture your

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
sister or brother. You do not have to be their teacher either.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Spend quality time with your sibling. Go to a museum, on a

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
walk or just chat over coffee. Hug your sibling. Sometimes

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
that feels nice too. Part of loving your sibling with special needs

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Includes encouraging him or her and not being too critical

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
of everything they do. Because as a child with special needs

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
one is put down and criticized too much throughout their lives.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Provide some common positive compliments and statements to your

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
sibling with special needs. Just show them love, a nice note or

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
letter. Finding out how they are and just to say you love them and are

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
thinking about them. Call your sibling now and then just

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
ask "how are you." Show some compassion and empathy.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Just love your sibling, no teaching or lecturing. Let your

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
sibling with special needs shine. Give them independence but

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Be there for them if they need you.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Thank you so much. Thank you Amy, this has been really a wonderful presentation.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Thank you very much. Thank you my

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:11.000
pleasure.
