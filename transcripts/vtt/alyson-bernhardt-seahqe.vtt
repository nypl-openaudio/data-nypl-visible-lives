00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
a Friday and, um,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000

balls with it.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I see you're able to move you're arm a little bit. Thank you. That's great.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
How you've been working with their therapist. Yeah.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
A lot. Yeah.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
So you'll get

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
there. Yeah, thank you. That's great.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
How do you, how do you manage day to day with, you know,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
know only having the use of one arm right. It must be really

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
really difficult. I mean to

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
to wash your hair, I mean I guess you can put your hair in a ponytail,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
ponytail or anything. Tell me, you know what some of the biggest

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
biggest physical challenges are for you.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Well, opening a jar [laughs].Yea.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Hopefully in

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:51.000
anything, I can do.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Wow you know that's so nice to hear, so refreshing to hear. Thank you.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Um. That's great. There's nothing you can't do. That's amazing.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Just takes a little more time. Yes.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
yes correct. That's wow, it's great I just got the goosebumps.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Thank you. That's so nice to hear.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
hear. Are you doing anything

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
to create awareness about stroke?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
or, I mean

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
an advocate for research funds or are you involved in any of those types

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
types of activities?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Yeah, Avi

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.000
has taken me to Turow college.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And I'm hopeful going to Adelphi

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Ivy Golden

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:50.000
who was um,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Um. Was, is he in your support group? Yeah.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Yeah. OK.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
So you know him through the

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000
the stroke support group. Yeah. OK, great.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Great. Avi is taking me

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
to Adelphi

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Adelphi, hopefully on

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
October uh ninth.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
And what. What's going to happen on October ninth?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
So we go and we speak about

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000
aphasia. Oh OK and to 

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
the freshman?

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Sophomore? or is it  anyone that wants to attend? Yeah.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Um.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Speech. We were speaking at a

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
speech.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
at Turow college.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And I don't know

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000
know what that's going to be like at

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Adelphi. So, you don't know what to expect

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
OK, really sounds exciting though.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
So, good luck with that. Thank you.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Um, So I want to speak a little bit about

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
about stroke and what it is exactly.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
And you know

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
hopefully, help other people become aware of

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
You know the symptoms, and what you can do to prevent it or, while you're

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
having the stroke. What, you know, what exactly

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
causes it, what what happens in the body physically?

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Well.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Migraines. Yes.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
I get migraines 

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
little. All

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000
through my life. So I

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:01.000
didn't get that. But migraines.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
I think.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Migraines. So you suffer

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
suffered through migraines? Friday,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Two years ago on Friday I was feeling icky

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Icky.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
But migraines. And you had a migraine?

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Yup. So you just thought that it was a regular migraine. Yes, but

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:35.000
I didn't feel right.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
In my

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
my speech got slurred.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
My arm again

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Again was weak

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
And I couldn't, couldn't move it.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
And my leg, couldn't

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Couldn't move. Well, I shouldn't say that

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:08.000
I'm. Hopefully. Yeah.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
I couldn't move it.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Yeah. What were the reactions of 

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
of your friends?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
friends? Did they support you and help

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
anything? Yes, Robin helped me

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000
She was exceptional.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Robin help me

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
with my speech homework

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Robin is one of your good friends? Yes. OK.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Um.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Robin help me through my exercise

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Yeah. So she is really there for you, supporting. Yes.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Supporting you, and helped you through

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:13.000
yeah, that's really that's really great that you have

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
someone. And, um Judy, who's um

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
My sister in law.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Helped me tremendously. And

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Mark. Who's my brother. OK

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000
And mom and dad helped me tremendously.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
You know. So you have a lot of help.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
That's good. Did you, when you were in the hospital, did you

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Did you ever feel like you're going to die

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
die from now? No. You weren't afraid or

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
scared of that? No. 

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.000
I asked that

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
because it's um, you know everyone's

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000
stroke is different and their experiences

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
are different. I know someone had a really bad experience in

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.000
the

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
hospital. And I'm glad that you answered so emphatically

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
"No!" You sound really like you were really

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
are really brave and really strong and still

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
today. I'm inspired

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
by you. Thank you.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
know. You know. I played over and over my head what you

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
said before,You can do everything you can do anything

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
it just takes a little more time.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:41.000
And just a little more slowly. Yeah.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
How

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
do you, can you remember a

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
time when your stroke

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Really affected you but you were

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:58.000
determined not to let it get the best of you? 

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
And it seems like all the time you don't let it um, you know

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
You know,overpower you. But is there one specific instance

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
instance that you can think of, and if not that's okay.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
hey that's good if you can't think of something.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Well. I was

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
frustrated

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
with the word finding

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:32.000
finding

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
and how is that for you today? Are

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
you able to find the

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
words? Uh

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
a little bit. Little bit. And you're still working on it?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Working on that. Yea.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
You'll get there someday. Thank you.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
yes. Is there any

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.000
anything that you want to share that I

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
haven't covered. Anything you'd like to let the

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
community you know about stroke awareness?

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
or

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
any any

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
particular challenges that you

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:21.000
faced?

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
So I guess kind of wraps things up.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000
up here. You were very helpful. Thank you. Very very inspiring.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
I think it's again, it's so great that you're able to

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000
work with what you have and you feel you're just so brave

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
and you're like a role model. Aw, thank you.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
So I want to thank you again for sharing your

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
experience. And that's about it, so thank you

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
you. Thank

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
you.
