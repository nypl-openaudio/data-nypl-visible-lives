00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Hello my name is Brian Gerber and I'm going to have a conversation with Adrian Spratt.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
for Visible Lines in Oral History Project at the New York Public Library.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It is July 1, 2015.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and this is being recorded at 135 Willow Street in Brooklyn Heights.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Adrian, I know, I known that you lost

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that you lost your vision at age thirteen.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But since you have become an attorney and have attended Amherst and

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Harvard. Why don't we start though with your early life. Why don't you tell me

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
a little bit about where you come from and growing up there.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I did it. OK I've missed. I was born in  and the time of Darlington which in

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is in the northeast of England. In 1954

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and uh I was born, my mother used to put it um

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
my legs angled at the knees so it was as if my feet were praying

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and I had a cleft palate, um 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So the cleft palate was repaired before I remember by surgery. And they did a pretty good job.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
pretty good job and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
job and. I spent five months, uh, 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
months. In the hospital when I was seven. Having my

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Achilles tendons transplanted and other sorts of surgery.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
surgery. Without that I would not have been able to walk.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So when I was four. I was also diagnosed with myopia.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Which the technical meaning of myopia is that the sockets of the eyes

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
large for the retina and so the retina is stretched.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
As far as I know I was never able to see out of my left eye and-- Although I don't know

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
what measure my vision was in the right eye--

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
um-- while I could see quite well I had to go

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to the school for the partially sighted

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
--which-- they don't exist any more in England but they did at the time. Now by then we have moved down

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
to Middlesex a suburb of London and I went to school in London from the age of four

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
four to ten. The uh cause of my

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
my various problems is something called Stickler syndrome which apparently is

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
the most common genetic syndrome there is. I've certainly read that.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Ah, but most people show very few symptoms

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and otherwise

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Otherwise-- The symptoms are kind of erratic. Some people have vision problems.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Some people

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
have the kinds of problems I had with my legs--um--

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The cleft palate is a symptom of it also.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 It's um considered a-a disease of the connective---

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
a degenerative disease of the connective tissue

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Anyway we'll come back to all of that but that was ultimately what

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
was the cause of my-uh-myopia

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 So I went to school for

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
the partner sighted as I said when we were in London

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And this meant for me to rise or two and a  half hours in

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
the morning to school and two and a  half hours back at night. So five hours on

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
this annoying bus for 6 years.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
a. I formed a very close friendship there with Bruce who's still

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
a friend of mine all these years later. Then we moved north to the town of  Sheffield

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
my father

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000
was an accountant. In fact, my father has a great story of his own, he left school at

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
He left school at 14 because his parents couldn't afford books.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
This is in what would have been 1942, during World War II.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
One way or the other, by going to night school and working in an accounting firm during the day, um

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
He was able to get uh qualified

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
qualified um- as what here we would call a C.P.A., over there a chartered accountant um-

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
A subdivision of Union Carbide. The American chemical company

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
that no longer exists. They hired him.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
 They brought him down to London. Then they sent him up to Sheffield to be

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000
a managing accountant. We lived there for three years and then he was asked to come to New York office

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Which is how our family ended up in here in the States.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It happened at the same time, just as

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I guess my parents decided to move here in the spring of sixty seven

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 and--uh they informed my brother and me after school was over.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 They didn't want to upset us. But my brother was very excited about it, I was a bit uh- I had mixed

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I had mixed feelings about it. I didn't really want to leave.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And so we were scheduled to come to New York in November.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
 And then in September um- I

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I experienced a detached retina

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
uh on my- the side in which I did have vision

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
 And [clears throat] that led to my

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
my being hospitalized for four yea- four months.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
My brother my father came over to the states in November. My mother stayed with me

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I was transferred to a London hospital

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
hospital. Finally was allowed to leave

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
leave and come to the States in January. I still had some vision. So

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
for my first  two months or so in the States. I had some vision. I was able

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
to see things like the

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
the ice on a beach in uh Darien, Connecticut where we ultimately moved

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
um- and vividly remember

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 the house where we're staying with friends of my father's in New Jersey.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And the absence of fences, um, all these trees.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I remember a glass of orange juice in the morning which somehow is a very vivid image for me

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
for me um- but I had

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But I had surgery again on the retina at Columbia Presbyterian in March

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and I'm afraid--Whatever vision I had before the operation

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
that operation put an end to [chuckle] so I had

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So I had a very tiny aperture of vision where I could basically see color

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
for the next few years and that closed towards the end of high school

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Okay, tell me about when you were in England

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
England and you-you- well two

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Well, two questions, I have really. One is

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
 Was the detached retina also connected with the Stickler's? --Yes it was--

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Yes it was-- I should have explained that, yes--  it was, it was, OK and what was

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
was it like-- in other words, forgive me Brian, the way in which it was connected was

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The Stickler's causes myopia

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So the retina was stressed. So I was always susceptible to having a torn retina and in fact.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So throughout my childhood I was told I had to avoid knocks, I had to avoid being hit on the head, 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
had to avoid any sort of violent motion and actually what triggered it

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
was I got hit by a cricket ball when I wad playing in school. On the head.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
OK so. So they kind of, this Stickler's kind of restricted

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
what you could do. Yes. You couldn't play a lot of games

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
 That's right yes-- wild things-- When I was in cub Scouts.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I could do, you know, the knots and things like that but I couldn't play any of the-the games, you know, the football um anything

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Anything that involved rough and tumble

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And You went to the school for the partially sighted

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
partially sighted. --Yes-- all the time you were in England? That's a really good question.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
By pure chance when we moved to Sheffield.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I did start out at a school for the partially sighted but they decided to experiment with

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
that school, the first in the nation,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and moved us

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:38.000
to what in England is called a comprehensive school.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Long explanation but it's basically what we would call a public school here.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And I went to that school for two years

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
for two years plus three weeks in September before my retina detached

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 So I was actually one of the first students  to be integrated, to use the term

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
of

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
 And I never wanted to go back to a special school after that.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And what um well what was the 

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:09.000
What was the difference actually between the public school and the special school, as far your studying and learning

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
you studying or um, you know, learning. Did they have different- --You know Brian--

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
You know Brian this is a great question. It's a long long answer but let me see if I can do a shorthand version.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
 The school in London--Essentially

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Each of, each year you had almost the same teacher for every class

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
 So I had my last year I had Miss Eades for

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
my English class. My arithmetic. History.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
All those subjects and... I kind of wish I hadn't mentioned her name

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
because she was a very bad teacher. So if you got stuck with a bad teacher you're really in bad luck. My very first teacher

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
teacher at that school was actually very good. And then when I moved to Sheffield-- same thing 

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
we had one teacher for all of our courses. So I had, I have to say, a bad teacher when I first arrived

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
first arrived but then for my

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
but then for my next three months I had a very, very good teacher who took me under his wing and at

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
that point there's

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
there's an examination that they used to give in England. I don't think they do anymore. It determines

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
 what quality of school you go to. If you pass, you go to, obviously,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
a higher academic school. If you fail, you don't.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and this teacher

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
 We would spend, you know, play time

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
 going through all the kinds of questions and subjects and things that I would have to

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
learn to pass this exam. And I did pass it.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It made no difference in the end because I had- I ended up going to this com- this uh- comprehensive school. Which was more mixed

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
more mixed

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
But in that sense

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I guess going to school for the partially you were lucky if you got a great teacher often

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
you often got not such a good teacher. Whereas in the regular school the comprehensive, or public, school

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
a public school, I had

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I had a different teacher for every subject.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Sometimes different students in different subjects.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So you got a lot more variety and, you know, presumably you've got people who are

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
more knowledgeable in their field. That's one big difference. I think another difference

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
is when you're in a special school. You feel in some sense

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
 Segregated from the rest of the population. And I know segregated is a lo-loaded word.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Loaded word as I'm saying it, um- whereas

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Whereas if you're in a regular school

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
There are disadvantages, you know, for example I couldn't do Phys. Ed. because it involved too much activity

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
For my head

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
But I did have conversations with people I

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
became slowly, very slowly, but over time I became friendly with people. And I became-- I came to feel

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
to feel a part of the class

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
 And in a sense, part of a society again. Well not again; for the first time.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So it was very special to me. --Yeah so you--

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So you actually felt-- Did you feel more comfortable in the regular school than at the vision school?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
 Not at first--not at first-- it was very difficult --Yeah-- You know, I had to sit at the front so I could see the blackboard.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Nobody sat-, you know, we had two person desks, nobody sat next to me for the first several months

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
 So I felt very conspicuous.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
But by the end of my second year

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I--It's not so much that I felt more comfortable--

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
It's that I felt more stimulated. --Ok. ok. So--

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So um, so

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So ok so now you're thirteen --Yes-- and your family has moved to the United States --Yes--

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
United States. I guess you didn't go to school immediately because of the vision problem

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Let's see we can January, had the operation in March. I

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I started eighth grade, which is

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Which is a year I was the right age for

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
For the last five weeks of that school in

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Connecticut. Um and they

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
they told me that the idea was that I would um- get to meet

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
my teachers because then I would do eighth grade the next year since I'd missed practically the whole year.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I was determined I wasn't going to do that.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And I was really fortunate my parents were extremely supportive

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
At that point I had no skills

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:12.000
a blind person would need I didn't have Braille, I didn't have typing skills.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
I-I guess I'm- any books that had been recorded I was able to read

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I had to have my parents read a lot to me I had students at the school who'd volunteer to read

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
 I had to dictate all my essays, all my tests, everything. One way or the other

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
other was all that support I got.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I was able to convince them that I could move on to ninth grade

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
This is after just five weeks-  --Yeah, yeah--

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Yeah. One reason was obviously the school system in England

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
England was probably about a year ahead anyway.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So some of the material is already familiar to me

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
me. Um but yeah, one way or the other, yeah

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Ha- By the way I think you said Stickler's is genetic

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
--It is-- Is there- were there are other people in your family that

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
that-- No I'm the first one

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
--You're the first one-- That may lead to another story later on

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
but I am the first one --If you want to do it now, it's fine--

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Well the story is along these

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000
these lines. In 198-

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
198-

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
1983 i guess, my brother

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
My brother's wife became pregnant

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
pregnant and I guess I should make it-

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I've used the word "Stickler's" if that was- I've always known that

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
it wasn't known by that name

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
name and just at least a decade maybe a couple decades later

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
later and when I looked into this

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
It didn't seem to have been discovered by 1954 four when I was born. And yet my parents

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
parents were told I had a genetic

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
syndrome I didn't know anything about it, I didn't- It wasn't really a part of my conscious

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
consciousness. But when my brother's wife became pregnant in

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
1983

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
They had their wherewithal to go and get genetic testing for my brother

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
He was cleared. But they asked me this was [?]

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
New Haven. I was in New York at the time

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
time they have got here in New Haven. And they asked me if I

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
would submit to the test also

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So I went there with my girlfriend at the time

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Um, I had the chest and that's when they determined I had

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
had Stickler's syndrome

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
which meant that I

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I was- essentially any child of mine would be- have a 50%

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
a fifty percent chance of carrying it which is a chance I wasn't willing to pass along

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
so at that point I became resolved that I wasn't going to have 

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
children um and cause my brother and his wife

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
went forward with their son who turned out to be a great kid, thirty years

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
old now. So let me know they've worked out I

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
think. I was fortunate in the Says I didn't have a driving desire to be a father.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So that since it worked

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
out. And your family.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
When you know when it became clear if you replace the pantry

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
or.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I'm tending to do right because if I hadn't you know what I haven't really thought of it knows

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Charles. We went through a very long process the form of US spent in the hospital

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
in Sheffield in The London.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I think made a huge difference to me personally and getting it isn't directly I

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
guess. I have already mentioned

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
have courses I have to be. While I was a boy. Before I was thirteen.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I just because you're with that against that was one reason why I was up playing on the field and why I

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
got exposed to being hit by that because a

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
ball. I just felt that I

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
was sort of a be Pen be worse and

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I was getting impatient with it and not enough of a half. Be myself about

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
all

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
that. So when I went to the hospital I was determined first of all. I was

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
going to handle it well.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
The second thing is I was put into a ward with many patients now in England it's very different from

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
the situation here. Here you might get a private room if you've got the money or to get a

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000
semi private room there. Generally end up in a public wallet in

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Sheffield is a world of. Eight

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
people without transfer to London it was water twenty two people thought it was

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
a big room.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000
But this. There isn't a spree to call them both wards of

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
the guys who are play friendly. Most people are not likely

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
to lose a vision they have being high. Issues.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
But in each case. I met a guy who was blind in Sheffield.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And that a man who had lost his sight. At the University of Sheffield gator

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
chemical accident.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Who was as well adjusted as anybody I've ever known was a wonderful one want to

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
bring in the being here twenty eight at the time.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
And then he befriended me and pad. He admitted later

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
on the surgeon asked

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
him to be fed me. But to go to sleep and I that helped me a lot. And then

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
when I was in Sheffield. And so in

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
London. I was introduced to a patient who is having a much harder time adjusting to

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
his vision love. They were still he thought it was still

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
hoping his. He was a Polish.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Credibly bright guy big with thirty mins the most intelligent man that ever known and then he lost

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
his sight in a radiation abstinent.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And he befriended me to he couldn't believe his that he was had to lie flat. As I had had to

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
do for two

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
months. But when I was allowed to get up and walk.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
I would love to see him. All the time. And he would make me tell mother loved. And he talked

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
about his experiences so

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
on so my. Just went through loss of

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
vision was

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
helped enormously by the people I met in the hospital those two I mentioned

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
and others. And the nursing staff and the

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:17.000
doctors. I think that may have helped my parents too.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Since my patches supported

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
throughout and your brother who's younger.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Two years ago. To

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
you about.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
But we were not close mean factory really dislike each other what is it my brother said.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
As an adult. Since we have to control it

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
so if he doesn't

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
understand how it. How he could have

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
said sort of what I want all this was going on in sort of ignored it. And you know a lot

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
of side I think. I thought of the I think.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Whenever know the truth of this. I think my brother. Suffered from was attention that

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
I got. I think he got less attention than he had to plan it

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
away and. I have to assume that I've taken in the.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
The the way we just for like crazy.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Until well into our late teens.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Probably natural reaction. It

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
is. You know when you say.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
OK makes it makes the whole situation as you get older that even though I

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
said that's true. Yes.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
So. So now you're in the United States. Yes.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
You become blind. You talked a little bit

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
about how the five

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
weeks is where you prove to them.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
You should be banned. To keeping track of this

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
plan and. You want to talk more of go down your adjustment

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
to blindness and going through the school.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Yes. Some After those five

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
weeks. You know I think. I want to say I have to mention

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
is when I came to the States. John you're sixty

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
seven. Johnny sixty eight.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000
In March of that year. President Johnson reside on another note he would run

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:11.000
again in June of that other cable. Assassinated.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
So you know commit his country that time. And I think that anybody living

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
here

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
was a child

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
of. I kind of the when I want. But it was

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000
a Senate it's just in time to write. Term or is a good word for it.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
So resign as a back and I you know

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I was I was you know obvious. I was told I had to

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
go to school for the Blind in Hartford Connecticut pull or kill for six weeks.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
In order to get some intense spell instruction.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Had to learn to type. And by tapping me on the

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
typewriter. So that with those six

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
weeks to probably of a help for Sally I know the typing help me a

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:02.000
lot without it with someone else. Schools.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
OK this is a residential stress take it still

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
exists. It has year round

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
student. But by that Point Loma was

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
blind students are being integrated I think the word he was mainstreamed

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.000
into

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
the various public schools.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
So I think most of the kids to read your rounded OK All were either they

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
have multiple had

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
accounts. Or they had home situations image of a difficult for them. That was my impression.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
So many of us are meant to summer school. Already in public schools

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000
and we can with there for some sort of special training of one kind or another. Most of

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
the people in fact I have guessing. I was learning it hadn't been there as a regular student at any time in

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
my life.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
And I said I was so nice learned to type was crucial to me

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
because. Well let me move on because I can hit show how

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
I became

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.000
crucial to make up to. My junior high school with Jennifer Hudson and then

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
with seven states and grace. So this is the last. You know how

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
I had to go through the same

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
equal. Dictating everything. Having a lot of reading done for me.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
At one point. I hope. There's

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.000
a teacher called not tenured teacher which many black people

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000
be familiar with this is a in the stuff

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
of a teacher who goes from school system to school

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.000
system within seconds of change in this case. Fairfield Connecticut.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
This situation has had two brothers all my friends Chris's my

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
man. And she made me realize my answers which you would

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
then transcribe it to print. Or sometimes she came I dictate which of a I guess you had time

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
for. But it meant you know the school day was extended by these two hours

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
and it was grueling. But one person said to

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
me. You know. It isn't you know you're taking advantage of people.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Which is not something I want to hear it all. But

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
I took it to heart and at that point instead of dictating I started typing. I was

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000
convinced a divide type papers.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
I would mention what I typed. Things were you know the the. The be a problem with a river

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
not have a whole page and nothing will come out.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
All of the things that happen. But in fact I got pretty adept at it as as everybody does.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
When you have to.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
And I was talking my own papers and which I will play rather I think it's at some point

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
in ninth grade.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
If I don't know it was. But I made a big difference because then all of a

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
sudden. I didn't have to be somebody all the time I could work in my

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
own. When I had tapes like to read my own.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
So that helped a lot

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.000
to me just interrupt was difficult even if you were in a close.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Yes. Did you did you. Could you recorded. Or did you did you take.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Three just

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
after the fifth. Two questions that could I have to go to this. I don't remember.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.000
I don't think. Cassette recorders were very book at that point they became available.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
You know I don't know that when a punitive or of course they use them once they

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
did so in order for me to record it Carter would have had to love this is huge.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Sony reel to reel in with the net result is no I did not. I did not take my

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
classes. And frankly I would have wanted to listen to them again.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:38.000
I think it has a lot of members ation. I just listened I took in what I could.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000
I don't mean the people taking notes from a class or buying notes as possible but I don't think so.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
So I think I'm in a related memory.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:53.000
OK All right so you saw anywhere you're in school. Your new stuff. Yes.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
You want to talk a little more about the school.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
OK because you learn Brown's. And you don't.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
So let me be cannot talk about those poll

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
numbers. Just one of the things I

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
learned is that the. What sometimes taught the black community is

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
extremely politicized and polarized. The bill is one of the subjects

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
really really gets people going.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:24.000
I am not a fast reader. I find it almost torture. Because of so slow that.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000
It was necessary for me is indispensable is how I got to high school

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.000
college law school and also my job now is if people don't have Bill. They

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
also perform well in each of those phases. The for me was helpful.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
But as I understand

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.000
that if you start learning to build a very young age.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Positive brain that most of us

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
use to read by

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
sight. Becomes a touch them to reading by touch

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
through

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Braille the brains. This is

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
a someplace that varied. Seven years old I think I've been eleven years

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
old relatively early age.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
The plane is not. If I pick up fluency in Braille if

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
you have learned in the very early age.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
So there's a you know it has a lot of value. But it. If you

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
are one of the bags of losing aside early very early life. Is that you can read. Really

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
fast and. I must say when I've been a good girl readers is quite something I

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.000
just clicked pages clipped at that I don't know how to do it.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
What did you do have your crew got to

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000
be. I spent some time during homework there was very

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
limited but

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
I I know what kind of articles for the school

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
newspaper. And I was in the

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
chancellor and I tell you a story about that.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
There were seven of us and it just up.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
I was an average player not a particularly good

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
one it was an extremely good player and it

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
just became a point at the end of.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
I guess junior.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Maybe the beginning and I think I may be to begin to see me.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
When we had to elect a president of the chest. So the seven of a sudden around this

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
table. And I figured I was going to vote for this

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
guy. And then everybody would have the drive as it is of their number one he was

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:34.000
very good of playing chess Number two he had organized told him it's. It is he deserved it.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
So he.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Said he liked to run he like to be

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
president and one of the guys

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
who wanted to give us a speech and one of me. You know maybe we have some just what I'd like to nominate

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
somebody else and so we just don't know it said I nominate a jury

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
and so all of a sudden there's a

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
competition and. So the guy

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
who deserve it just means you know the idea. A little bit offended but he had the wherewithal

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000
to get past a great quickness and so. OK John I guess you have to give speeches if you want me

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
to go further shaken if I said well there's a bit new to me so what do you go first now think about what I'm going to say.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
So he went first to get a perfectly purpose speech which along the line. I hate

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
giving speeches. But I've you know I've I've organized as I've done that.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
I think I've got and

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.000
you. Mean but I was thinking. As

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000
a tremendous amount of hostility Melor the chance to play this for some reason they didn't like this guy half of them.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
I said. If I'm elected president.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
I promise to bring. Peace and quiet. And I will be

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
more than happy is this other guy's resources if it's willing to continue to

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000
provide them.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
So we have a reason voted for the guy sitting in

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
south. Season voted for me.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Respect me really deciding

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
the. And I was thinking my college applications and how I can have a whole lot of

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
heads of political activities. And I thought of

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
unless you prove. I was a question if

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
you provide a crime.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
I think so and I felt like a fraud.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.000
You felt like a fraud Yeah Frogger you voted for us because of that going to let the I knew

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.000
the other guys love the people of Israel. So we did.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
OK So how did you decide to you really kind of made it through high school.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Yes. Obviously very well. Yes you said you went to her sister.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
How did you decide where to go to.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Like I was cancer was tremendously helpful we have that she had

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
no no knowledge of the American system.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
The universes we had of a year and half of it like everybody else

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
what my parents had not met my father that's going to

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
fourteen my mother left school when she was sixteen.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
So I think a cousin of my father. Going

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000
to Oxford but that was

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
it the. We really had no experience of

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000
a. You know beyond high school. My high school

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:14.000
counselor guidance counselor. Gave me a list of colleges that he thought I

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000
should consider playing

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
to. Most of them were small liberal arts

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
institutions to them with an

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
analyst and. I pretty much stuff is on those two for

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
writing reasons well. Yeah because I've heard of it.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:34.000
And then they went to visit and most I was so taken with the whole community

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
atmosphere it's in a semi pro. Part of western

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Massachusetts town.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
And so I thought oh yeah except I mean within a month of my playing.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
So by twelve but I knew I was

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
also. I'm a nurse. Many of you me that this would

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
never happen today.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
The. You do you have a mission. I think I can say. Name team also

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
don't keep referring to me some anonymous

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
way. Dean was saying we've

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
had one experience of a blind student before. And it didn't work out very

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000
well. He had a lot of difficulty getting his reading done.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
He ended up relying very heavily on the faculty wise. And in particular

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
on the president's

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:30.000
wife. So we had some misgivings about that.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
He said in a way that made me feel he wanted to accept

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000
me. And that blindness was just a call now that could not be

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Saturday. And I wasn't told about this.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000
I Ching.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
So in retrospect. I find it refreshing. But I knew what I was up against.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.000
There's no beating around the bush there's no coding it was no

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
code words to say what they really meant. It

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
was in the open. I told him

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
that. By that point

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.000
my diary on the child was in school had a terrible organization.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
There was a national organization they were told is for the Blind which you by one of you for

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
I know that.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
And I was accustomed to working with students some of whom would

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.000
get would be paid by the state of Connecticut. And they might spend some who of whom

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
with volunteer.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
One radio that I was able to persuade him that I had the resources and he sat on that until March. So

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
you

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
know what I'm a left before the people are notified I was there.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Septimus

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
well. And I went up

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
challenged in April. For those dozen between I must and.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
I loved. And this is a place.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Yeah one has a commuter prestige. That I'd grown up with an

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:58.000
England. Happened. Just by pure chance on the day that is when

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
my track mentioned I went up here and was

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000
together. There was a meeting in the quad with all of

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
the college.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Including professors administrators.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000
And the question

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
was whether this. How was the school going to protest.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
The latest events in

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Vietnam and China what they want to play think at that point it was

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
the bombing of high for the mining if I find a bug up. All I know

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
it I think that's what the

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
event. And the discussion which is

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
so

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000
civil. I was accustomed to discussions in class where people get sort of

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
aggregating religion other and get kind

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
of agitated and and a loyal one with are

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
they you can then. I think they were interesting they're fascinating but they didn't feel

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
like

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
rational discourse and I guess that appealed to me a lot. And then everybody spoke so.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Flirting with such consideration for the listeners.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
I just went home and wrote life. I said yes I'm allowed to come.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000
That same evening. It's a nice way

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.000
to shoot. It was that it was the right decision. Now.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Hers is ruled. Yes several at this point

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
to get to the right.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
How did you get around. Did

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
you get of or use a cane I've never heard

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
of that.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
I got on the weekend.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
I really don't have a lot of

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
them on the systems at the time.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
I have if it was one of those people who was embarrassed

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
by the way

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Kane. It felt like

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
a how did I say. I suppose

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
a. It with a let the scarlet A net has

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:55.000
to print. Started as it.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
I mean it had a falling cancer any time

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
I didn't have to use it I followed it up. So I mean I was on a boat walking with

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
other people. But I gradually gradually. You know I realize this is just nonsense a guy.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000
It was not acceptable.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000
I ventured got the point was walking along with that weapon

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
myself. This is.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
I think a child for a little bit

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000
because. It's funny you

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
know what look at this but you know I have really tried to make it my life out of writing the

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
last fifteen

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
years. And I've been a memoir. Covering my first

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
up to the public discussion. And of it and what about those sort of never going to write about

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
tonnages consumers look complex and difficult.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
If you go for two

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000
years I've decided that. Everything I've done up to that point in my

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
life including analyst. Have been pretty much feel good.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
It

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000
doesn't I don't mean to say that I can have a choice. As I said he did have choices I had

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
a choice pencils about which close to Goes Boating. I was entirely by my posting the pressure may well

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
my the

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
other. But. And obviously I've worked hard to get the grades

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
I got. But it all started as there was a pail and I hadn't gone. I

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
hadn't stray from it one

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
bit a couple things happened I decided I

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
wanted to teach English at the college level. My major was

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
English. And I was advised.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
I had some French I'm not because they're too French but I you know Cumberland French forces.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
I

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
decided if I press gotta gotta gotta stop one of

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000
my people fast is actually professional Russian So you know I know you like

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Russian literature but you really should learn German that would help you know more such as

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
OK I'm going to go to summer school to learn German. Now where I want to go to summer

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
school plays in this puzzle for some reason I'd always been jointer

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
was not

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
real which I never been to. So I applied chemical university for the

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
summer program. And they let me

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
and to take this jet engine introductory German intensive

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000
course. So.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
That trip I took to Montreal.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
What kind of attorney pop me

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
because I was doing something that I no one had expected me

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:31.000
to do as Don't you know following things by myself where I I knew nobody.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
So there's and yet making this I actually register a

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
friend of mine in Maine. So I took a bus to Boston he pick me up.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
We spent time at his place in

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Maine for week. And then I got on a bus important for this eleven

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
out journey to Montreal.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:55.000
And I got my freshman Dean who was picked

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
as Imus was raped and sort of he

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
had a lynching. Teachers

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
and teachers applied to meet me at the bus station and putting up

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
overnight. And then I would just go to university and just figure things out from

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
the. When we got to

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
the border. When the past got to the border of

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Canada. Customs. So maybe my

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
girls

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
work. And asked me to get out of the bus.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
So. And then to ask and they indicated what is Alex Alex

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
because it's an introduction to German. How do you how do you know how do you read

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
it and open up a book I said well listen I don't know German have studied it you have read

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
you a lot and they are probably butcher this so I read him a line.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
And he said You must be take this. And he took the but he took the

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
book. And I was definitely. Mostly by myself.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
And I figured the bus to God My love is on the bus.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
What are they going to do. Just as at that point in my life I just knew that

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
that or rather I guess I decided

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:11.000
that whatever happened. I was to go with her.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Anyway. They came back and said OK.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Show me back to the bus and it's the same bus that kept his eyes in that hole

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
out. If there was a was

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
six eight in the imbalance when I walked down the aisle back to my seat. The woman who had been sitting

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
next to me I think we can control what each other but she moved to the window.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.000
I sat down and said nobody said a word.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
We make another how into Montreal you lived up to all of the

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
past figures in the next this woman would be. She

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000
was. With the. Die

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000
I was to learn to just have no two days earlier.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
And. They took me to that place. And made a nice meal

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.000
and then. Wonderful. And then they drug me to the universe the next day.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
And then from there on edges. Oh I'd

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000
rather the next day I got an orientation. As stated in orientation session

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
with somebody

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
with the Quebec. I don't know what they call themselves now the the. There's been any but

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
the department for vision impaired people for the blind whatever. He came

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
in an alum there so we went from light on which is up on approach remote

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
while. All the way down to shut up street and then a long ship of

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
street to. The place was going to be taking this German

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
calls. And so that took and I was alone walking in even after

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
was accused about forty minute walk. Even when I was accustomed

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000
to so let him with over. He said. OK.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
I said well can we do some more like. I never use a Metro my own how do I do

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
that

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
subway. Well you know I want to turn structures for the

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
whole problems of Tibet. Now. What's real what is a very big city.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
And a poem is looked at back to St Giles the size of Texas in the area. So I

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
feel pretty selfish enough but I said. Well. Anyway so he Greece give me one more lesson

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
in their week later

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000
and show me how tos ee a matter of my own. Which I didn't did and so

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000
I that whole summer was dipping around lunch real. There's places.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
On my own and with friends and was a fabulous time

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
and you learn to be myself. Forgive me. You learn to be more

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
self-reliant Exactly.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Is another conceive of the rebels driving it reflects a

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
psychological step and it's more the more psychological step in anything else.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Yes. Did you graduate from Amherst with the Major. Yes I

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:53.000
guess I got it a similar day and I was elected the commencement speaker.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
To remember to pick one.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
No I do I I think it is. Again you know you have to question the way that I can formulated

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
I think is a somewhat rambling

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000
essay. That was sort of trying to make a point

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
that we go on all about worse and worse and worse. And in the end.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
The silence or something like that.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
OK so. To you but you said you went to law school you went to

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.000
a lot

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
harder to do is at a measly after graduating

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
from law. Yes. And so I was there to start because I mentioned to you that I

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000
had wanted to be. I was a teaching years on the color. College level.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000
I was always between my sophomore junior Yes.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000
I decided OK. Now I need a job.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
I wish I went and asked for a

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
job and had never been to the south before I want to go to the south and.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000
You know for me. Just go to some place. Traveling through.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
It's not Nova satisfy. What a ghastly lives a place.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
One way or the other able to get a job with a community action

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000
agency and a child of yeah can build in the northeast corner northeast

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
North

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Carolina. What I was that's what is very difficult to get rid of.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Can I I was seventy five dollars bike Weekly. My

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.000
rent was small enough that it actually meant something in that image so much

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
as ever to

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
fly to Washington D.C. for the July fourth weekend. To see friends of mine and like

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
that all on the salary.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
But I discovered I just I couldn't pay for readers so you know I had to

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
realize what it

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
is yet occasion never was not high among the people who were

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000
able to volunteer. Is a real part

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:53.000
of. But I really I mind the work the agency did they

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000
did start. They implement programs job training.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Funny people jobs over ideas. So as soon as a little program.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.000
I realize I really want to contribute in some way. At that

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000
point. And the question was

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:16.000
how. I don't so.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
It's become it becomes clear to me

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:23.000
that there's a real risk and going to teaching. Thinking. Going

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
into teaching. That's what I have to have about seven years

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000
of of graduate school and I wanted to be financially independent sinners

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
and. And second of all

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
just. Q Many people work in the same job that I

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
did more than I felt competent somehow but on the other hand I

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
get so anyway so that was one. Well opportunity one option I was

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
considering that. Then I thought OK

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
so a lot of this work with social work in North Carolina. How

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:53.000
about becoming a social worker.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.000
I came to paging and I probably would have money to be able

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.000
to hire my readers. Again I find myself and. Bishop depending

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
on something that wasn't entirely reliable.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
I thought about psychology. Had some reservations about

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000
the moment that Iraq law as people

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
do and. So let's read this article.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000
OK so. And did you

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:24.000
find. Was school getting. You know the problems of

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
being blind to the

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
different. She

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:34.000
was. Well.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
I don't think the problems are being blind were different I think.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
When one. One

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000
respect. The first one to say

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
that I was your last project through your program and my three years the.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
There were six other places

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
that it was complete contrast to what I've gone through before

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:59.000
and what high school I was a second by student. Same thing that I

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
must tell you should have. First or second person in

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
whatever institution I ended up

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
in. However is different. There was a

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
woman who was a graduate student who was teaching at the fetch a spirit of

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000
diplomacy. And then there are other. Blind of the blind

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
or students and with various interests.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
So at that point you know I wasn't an exception. In that

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000
school. I don't wonder. The real problems for

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
the people who don't have any vision and is up and I didn't.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Is

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:38.000
insomnia. And if it has a name the seven twenty four.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Since I was something like that. And so I.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:49.000
For most of my life know I being infected by some in the way I was having that up in north

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
or was

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
that exam period was a nightmare for me because

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:59.000
I think you know. Between that syndrome and. Just the sheer

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:05.000
tension taking exams or lot more exams I've taken. College college as much about writing papers.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
So I was totally fighting. Just just being get tired. Each other

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
and so that was a real struggle I mean even though it's not blindness as such

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
is so near an outgrowth of

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:22.000
blindness. And then my second year.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
I got

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.000
mononucleosis. So that was another thing I had to settle this.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.000
So I can go still harder. But I was a partner particles of insomnia.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000
And partly because it wasn't a subject that came naturally to me

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
as others have as such I said. I remember

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000
there's a woman in my my hospital class who like to read poems.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000
And she she looked at her I suggest you look at my right hand surgeon general.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Your logic line is a very long.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
And then she looked at my left hand over the last was read on here that means you're going to learn it.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
So there was so.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000
So yes. One million I got through

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
those and you know I got my summer jobs I got a job in Wisconsin because

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:15.000
I want to go to the upper Midwest. Working for the state public defender.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.000
My numbers between first and second year. For my second year I interviewed a very special firms.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000
I think it any of

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000
us. There was a period lies through that at

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Harvard who had done an experiment just to make the public.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
But she sent. That's a trainee application to very

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
slow in New York and Boston.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
In half of them she indicated she was

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
blind and the other half she did not.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
She got invited to interviews by all of those rare she did not indicate it. Ten to none of that

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
Reggie

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000
did. So it's pretty clear we

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
had a problem. Yeah yeah.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:01.000
But one of the people I interviewed one of the organizations was a minister the attorney general's office.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
David

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Gray and between not getting the experience or you know

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
the private firm experience I was hoping to

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000
get at between just how much I like these guys. I

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.000
was really happy to go there. Simple Minnesota. So I did

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
that and I had to graduate.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Now. This is pretty much anyone thirty of them

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:26.000
still in both cases they are they also well.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
There is doesn't count headed out of his you know I got along great

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:34.000
a misstating touch for a long time afterwards. You certainly would have me back. And the Minnesota

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.000
people have me a

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:41.000
job. And I thought they were funny tell me by that point it's clear to me I was astonished.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
And I also wanted to commit the

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.000
crimes which is what I tell him it's constant.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000
So my last year and most of us in terms of employment

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
I

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.000
was looking into

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.000
various criminal defense

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
organizations have to do with. Legal

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
research. Mainly with

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:08.000
readers with me.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:15.000
It should still be obvious. Except in mind that we have a certain body. And there were no computers.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
So I was really depended on

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:22.000
readers. And it's not

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000
just indicated that it's not just a question of having them read text.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:31.000
I would have to. I would have

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:36.000
to tell them what I needed from cases. What positive step.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Something called Shepherd izing. Which means you want your very case you think is relevant to the point you want

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:46.000
to argue. You see where the case has been cited that's a fairly complex system.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000
So I had to educate my research is

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
that. And there are various other research tool so every time I took on a

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
new reader. I have to go through this. Educational process as well. Teaching

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000
process. But I was because you have

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
to reset the really. The Go.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
No The only time I've worked with. I generally avoid work with us today or.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.000
No students because I wanted to be sure that it was my own work product.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000
No local people have

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:24.000
that. That's a part of your accent and picked.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:29.000
But it's not just an ethical issue. But I want to be sure that it was my We're part of the it is the exception to

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:35.000
that was when I was working on a joint project for example for the.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000
The truck that was called the moot court competition. We risk.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:44.000
We had to part of the US. So I did work with a friend who's a law student. And I was actually very

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.000
experienced this from working with

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:52.000
her. There were no books.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:57.000
I actually know the because books were recorded by recordings for the blind again.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
They

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000
were more lost more than any other two. Totals for the climbers

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:07.000
was invaluable for me. And even books that hadn't been recorded. If I

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.000
was able to place a

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000
request. Had enough. They had a early enough in the

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:21.000
summer. The tech to start arriving as a semester read on.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:27.000
So you want to go into criminal to. Yes. OK And did you. Yes you did for

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
a job. Yes.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Yes. And specifically on the appeals level.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:36.000
At that point I was really hooked on need to research I was hooked on more than anything making legal arguments

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000
and putting them in writing.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:45.000
There are very few opportunities available and even a few of them that the paid in any way.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
I would call

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000
adequate. The job. I got the jobs

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:57.000
are interesting me. I'm retired forward here in New York City. With the Legal Aid

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Society. I had come to New

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000
York. You know Mike my family that can die

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000
in Connecticut. I had a number of friends from college and law school who live in the New York

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000
area so we would come to intern New York to me expand the day whatever.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
So that was my experience in New

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
York and next month so I didn't want to move there and first it was really.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000
I have to say I love Boston and. It's not a very friendly place just not it. You know what I was in

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:30.000
the Midwest in the south accompanied her family people the bottom of all the cold.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:34.000
But I had so many college friends and also feds. That I became

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:42.000
very and I just became very touched the city. I don't know the press being reserved I grew up in England.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:45.000
But you know it to me was just just I just

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.000
had their stupidity it didn't appear to mean any other way but I have a job.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000
So I

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000
moved to New York.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:54:01.000
I busted. You know to people this new you know. By know each other a little bit we. You have a.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Your former colleague of my partner. Lower than we just had lunch before we did

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:11.000
was taping sessions I would explain to you. Is it the drug or finding my apartment here.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000
But we could go on forever with this one with the other a first

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
apartment here in Brooklyn

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Heights. And I

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
had one or two friends you moved here from law school.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:31.000
But nobody living in this neighborhood. I really had to figure out a lot myself trying

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000
to achieve was one

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000
story. Believe myside he was down in the

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:42.000
park growing in time time and hadn't been in a city hall is on the same block there. Jane

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.000
are music well used to beyond. People know that

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000
name. So I think of working with

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
as giving him the blower

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:56.000
option I contacted as a serious a contact at the

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000
lighthouse. Jassem for orientation.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
To my

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000
workplace. They said. You live in Brooklyn.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000
It's not our job. So I can't have the what was then called industrial holes in

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:14.000
the blind. Him but it was not taught as a carer

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
services. And they said well we don't really know Manhattan.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000
But will help you

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.000
out. So they sign with this woman.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.000
So it has an

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000
instructor and regiment than she had no idea

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
learn between a trivet we figure things

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:35.000
out and being no intentional structure she knew your

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.000
various landmarks to point out to me that would help me and my

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:43.000
journey in much any involved is cheating separate start really to Park Place.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Subway

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000
stop. But others that had to cross over city hall part and then I

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000
had to cross over.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Parkhead protecting them and I think. If you there for the end of six lanes.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Perhaps get to a certain spot. So that cost safely. You know let. Others

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:05.000
have lived worked and another chapter Patton's worked. All of that she was very

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.000
helpful with and you know one way or the between the two of us really because the figured

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:15.000
out. But that's what I hear. Also I live up to the point.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Every institution of the blind have been really helpful to me or my professors have been great. And

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:25.000
my teachers in store that will stay. The mystery is this is

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000
where found my first

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:31.000
conflict. In New York yes.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:36.000
So what. So you started legally. Yes. What

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:41.000
was it like there were your first piece is what was there any reaction from the clients

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
to

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:46.000
you or my cursor in

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.000
general in this is doing the people's work.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000
They've all been convicted. I think I'm in that one of my tights once

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
a

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
teenager who actually liked a

00:56:54.000 --> 00:57:00.000
lot.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Had a variety of cases.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.000
While. Involved a guy who had robbed

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000
a supermarket.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Only cold blustery snowing. January day.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:21.000
He got any time drove off. But the peak. Caught up with him. Soon

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:25.000
enough and they had this chase. All the way down to be curating into Sunset

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Park had about thirty miles an hour. Because the weather the SO BAD.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:36.000
But one was there that they kept going and they caught him and. So I have got

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000
his appeal I don't know what is your what the legal

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:43.000
issue. I had a guy who was

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000
convicted of

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:50.000
murder. A guy going into a bar on

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000
the west side of the west of

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:57.000
this kind of open fire. He

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:59.000
killed three people injured.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Two. One of them was the particularly the. And the

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:08.000
by bartender. You know. John W.. This guy whoever it was

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:10.000
named and shot him point

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:14.000
blank. And they just left. There's no obvious I recall

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:21.000
just. I just I mean I don't know if it took me from the top but I know he left.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000
The evidence against him

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000
was. Was I mean this is said it was definitely

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.000
him. One eye witnesses as it doesn't it wasn't him went through to run

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Sure. There's one of the piece of evidence which was it to reflate

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:39.000
or this guy was arrested at the scene of a robbery.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000
With the same gun. So essentially my argument was

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.000
think I'm insulted because she was

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000
unreliable and. Anybody with half a brain with dumps like God. So

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:56.000
chances were. The guy in the second lobby wasn't him.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
So if you know.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Now. And they have pissed of

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000
the appellate division which is the court that bothers and

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.000
square. Which handles appeals

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000
from state Supreme Court cases. I should say state.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Cases in Manhattan. In the

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:22.000
Bronx. And they do not.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.000
You know. By my

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:28.000
argument.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:34.000
Did you went to court. So. Argued. Yes.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Yes. That's a question. I've

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:42.000
read I

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:44.000
think you want to in directly

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.000
without at Minnesota's in the attorney general's office there. I was busy. So look at

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.000
the general's office he had a variety of different cases

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000
great. But I'm. I have some vague memory with this I

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000
must've had some contact with

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
the. Whatever organization they have a vision impaired people in

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Minnesota for time is not going to cause i'm a guy and I was amused by Minnesota cock of

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
the

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
guy. He asked me something to do with work.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
And I didn't have the answer.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
At that point I said. How about a call you

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000
back. And he said you know when you're blind you really have

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000
to be really with answered you have to do you have to know your stuff or somewhere there

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
is always a speech. In one sense.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Was unfair.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Because why. What was wrong with my calling him back.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000
But on the other hand. I think he made a really good

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
point in the abstract which I took to heart. Which

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
was to the extent

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
possible. I would have

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000
to be eight be as prepared with

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:58.000
answers. As I could be and. In the same vein.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Going to court. I thought it was very

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000
important that I present myself with as

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
much autonomy as possible.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
The first department. This is his appeals court in

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Manhattan. Is very helpful in that regard. Not not

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:20.000
by not intentionally. Been there for a very long

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:24.000
time but because of the five judges justices who were sitting

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
that day at the front.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
You have two that turns one

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
to the plaintiff's cause

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
any. The district attorney depending on the kind of case. On one side.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
And you have

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
the lectern for the

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
defendant on the fence on the other.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
On the other left. And then there are several

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
rows of seats

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000
facing the judges. And there's an hour down the middle.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I would guess the caught early ever go over the read evidence for driving results back over the

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
river. I mean the subway station

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:07.000
nearby. And we make sure we've got a seat where I could sit on the aisle.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Near the front.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Now a lot of kids the heard in the afternoon on a dipole than likely to be

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
told as I'm home I can I stand up.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I go down the aisle.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I actually said I've We had to survive before the top is in session. I'm practicing events.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I gota get right to the elected without a problem because I've practiced

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:35.000
it. That I would know what to do I get my talk as wait for the other side to get their

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000
top of their argument. And then I was there to

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:44.000
walk back to the does or what does the code or. My witness stand up she made me where

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
we live together.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.000
So totally out of it was very important to me. So you know when you ask. When he said

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I I was in court. Yes. That's a very important part of pending trial

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:01.000
look. So you. How we're really

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000
going to know how he

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:09.000
asked her what happened was they didn't like me.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
You know

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.000
I would say with a muscle or with a woman. As

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
it was in those school. Was a general store she

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:24.000
she she was very much a business which is the only person I knew in college you read Wall Street Journal.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000
She got into the restaurant

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:31.000
business and. We were very close.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000
And just so so why can't you know what I think effect what are we having a fat like I have we have a

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000
relationship. You have to have

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000
being in a job for a lot. You know for these two years.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Because you need to know failure

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:52.000
because at some point. When you're when you're in a job think they go about

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000
you and you're going to be very upset and then happen that's when start going

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.000
up and Legal Aid is.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.000
You know when I talk about this and when I write about this.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Mr Diaz. Beyond the point now.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
I don't want it to be

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
about me defending my work.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Holiday defending

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.000
themselves but there were certain things that I

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:23.000
learned I think the thing that most troubled me when I was there.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I try to explain this in a way that makes sense.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Each of us lawyers. Well there is a status to providers and

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
the supervisors. What what a supervisor Besides every priest that was in by

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
the staff

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.000
attorneys. So I had my first degree stand by the woman is

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
supposedly restraining me.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
And then. And then essentially was put in the pool today. The next person

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
who DO with you my work.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
So a problem that we still are

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:04.000
drafted and the problem was that I haven't. He did me a while to figure out what this

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:07.000
was when you realized I was on in fact you know I

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000
was completely on the trial transcript when you're doing appeals

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:15.000
work. One part of the transcript was the

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
prosecutor's summation.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:22.000
To do it. Now. I haven't used that. And the reason I haven't used

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
that had to do with my experiences in Wisconsin.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Which is where because they come again I think as a whole I want to skip all that and just say.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I hadn't used it I had a reason why I had used it.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
It was a mistake. I should have used it.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
But the conclusion that the supervisor Drew

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.000
was it should've been just that look you know when

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
you've got a resource. You're representing a client you use all the resources. Resources a cat.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
That's a legitimate point to

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000
make. But if confusion is she drew was

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:59.000
it because I can see I can be relied on to read the whole transcript correctly.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Now. I have certainly the cautions in place. I have

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
my readers read every page

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:11.000
number. I have a case file a trip to my side

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:16.000
of the desk. I handed over each item mother's emotion. Whether it was

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:22.000
an interim decision whether it's an exhibit whatever. I would hand over the yard to my reader.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Have him or her read it to me.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Hand it back to me I make my notes I put it back in the folder I take the next item handed to them.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000
So I was in control the whole time what was red and I made sure we were the entire file. All the way from

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
going to

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000
and several really

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.000
unfair. What was really bad about what she did

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
was. That

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
she had put in an instruction and any time.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I submitted a brief.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
I had to submit a trial transcript with it.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
I was only lawyers objected to that

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
requirement and it was.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Demobilizing. Hand. Yet he

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:08.000
never improve from that point. The matter how much I learned how much I proved

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
has been a year so I was writing puter top if you. Time as

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
a few corrections.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
But I still getting very negative

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
reviews. Now the reason. Office work. I

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000
wasn't alone in this. It wasn't just because I was

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000
blind and. I don't I can't say how much that contributed.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:33.000
There's some of us who are very highly thought of some of the survey police or the girls on

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
that subject alone

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000
time. But I would just said it's just as my kind of indication. Wrong that

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
big

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:45.000
issues. These ladies semi private but most of us funding comes from the city.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:51.000
The city is all over was unhappy with the labor because they were producing enough food.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:56.000
You know the Ne Ne needed more turns to be represented which is fair enough it's

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:00.000
logical. So the supervisors run under a lot of press. To get

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:05.000
these cases are we a separate units under a lot of pressure to get the cases out.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
I was on the elevator one day after I'd already got another job and I didn't like the moment.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
I was on the elevator taken a one

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
day and happened at the president of the canape was on the same elevator usually

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
different floor.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000
He was president the whole society which had a whole variety of services.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
He said. Congratulations. And I think most of you know to

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000
a body part of the job. But I thought this is giving this to myself. The

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
congratulations after. What those who walk through is a go because for being the most

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
productive attorney

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000
office. Anyway I learned that I was never

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:46.000
told anybody else. Can come. Just a casual comment I mean your image is

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:50.000
a great guy is a nice guy.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
I learned so many things from that I one thing is that

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
the. The the very first lecture we've got a legal aid

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
in this the seven of us who knew

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.000
that in September. At the very first lecture that they had an officer.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:10.000
I like she was place like a private. So the assumption is that all your work

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
would be perfect.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.000
The only colors are going to get of criticism of a negative.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Otherwise it's assumed that is perfect.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
And there's really not very good because there is a come from a variety of those dollars

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000
and I think many of the press gauges we've worked hard. We had the going to

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000
lose. And we were not going to get emotional support and emotional support

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
really does matter.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Yeah. And I know what it's like

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.000
to be in a job where you know well thought of and that's a really rough

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000
way to start your career.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000
But I was really fortunate. A friend of mine from college I lost

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000
also having been working in the attorney general's office here in New York City.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.000
The state attorney general's office with a kitchen. Force Protection Bureau.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
And he introduced me to that office.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
And they hired me. And things turned around.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
OK So what's going to

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000
do. And how long were you there.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000
I was at seventeen

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.000
years. I

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000
began as a dedicated

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:27.000
meaning not was to skim it was a definite I mean

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:35.000
this is such an elaborate name it should really be consumer protection.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
We. If you don't have a serious complaint against

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:43.000
a company or if we knew that they're engaged. Or we could prove rather that are engaged in some kind of

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:48.000
live. Persistent. Illegal conduct.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:54.000
We were it is a choice that what we were trying to negotiate a settlement almost always. And if need be sue them.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.000
So that was my work for the first four

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:00.000
years. You start. No longer on the appeals level. I

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
was in the trial

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000
level. I did know that your trial that

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:13.000
if you like I said it was one child comes to mind I did you want.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Most of it was a negotiation of one kind or another or filing papers.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
And having kids be so pretty much in the

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000
papers. But. We also had

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000
a mediation unit.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Lot of

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.000
lawyers will try to resolve into individual complaints filed with others.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
I'm OK closely with those

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:43.000
people. And I found a very warning.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000
Because the long haul or got with cases where we were suing

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
people more

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.000
so this could have been settled it does need to guard your the celebrity.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:58.000
You know all these Bollinger papers.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000
In many ways just kind of glamorous. I got to do T.V. work I'm

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:05.000
like cases I was on T.V. news a few

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
times. But I just thought that it

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:14.000
could be done more economically could be done with less of the businesses. In some cases I thought we

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
were rather harsh

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
sometimes and sometimes it is OK. Obviously that's

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000
true. And one of the other I work closely with a mediation program and it

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000
was noticed at one point I was asked after I'd been there for years if I would be willing

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
to take over that

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000
unit which I was. And that was a very good time

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
for me.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Because I was able

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
to see. It was a

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
fairly new unit.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
We had a whole lot of

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:51.000
history. I was able to meet with the help my mother. In fact.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Let me begin to strain. My first case I held a meeting with all the mediation

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
stuff and said

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.000
No I will not I know I'm in charge and I really don't know what you do.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
You're going to have to teach me. Give me six months. And

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
that's and by then I hope I can

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
be more of a contributor. The no than the trainee

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
in

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:18.000
effect around. And they were great. We were very close again of

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
a amicable way. I was able to appoint a deputy who

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000
is still a friend. But I did of them as

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:29.000
night. And then when he left to go

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
to at the age of forty five to little still. Figured if I could be

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:39.000
alive so so he then as it were to apply to another guy. As my deputy.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
His posts are friend and a really good

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:45.000
guy and so full of essentially thirteen or fourteen

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.000
years. We just kept improving and improving that person we handled. Eighteen

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
thousand complaints a year.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I was eventually asked to take over the whole state why program which

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:03.000
is fifteen or sixteen offices. So we do fifty thousand employees.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Evolve toward a nation with lawyers in various beers really within the

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:13.000
agency. And a lot of the mistreated stuff. I I want

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:17.000
to keep updating. Some areas of teaching the laws

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.000
apply federal state and. You know

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.000
city. Which is pretty comprehensive there are so many consumer

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
protection services standing.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.000
I go to a guy sitting mediators hoster resources so they

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
became a

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000
very streamlined. Program. And because of all of that there are a lot

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000
of disputes that I got involved with my mother and like be involved directly

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:47.000
in trying to resolve a dispute. I'm more likely I

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
would help a mediator figure out what strategy to

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000
use I reviewed every letter before it went out.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:58.000
And what's the world if we got a lot of complaints against a company rather than sue them. I would ask them to

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000
come in and see if you can work

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:04.000
out a solution to the to the more generic problem they're

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.000
having which usually worked out very

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
nicely. So it was a very nice was a thing it

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
was most amazing about it was here was no very politically

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.000
sensitive situation. You know the attorney general in your selective upset.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
And yet. I got almost

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000
no.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Interference from the powers that be.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:33.000
Come. I think I had only one discrete whole time I was there about a particular complaint that we are

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.000
handling. And we want to pressure sometimes you have a

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:43.000
lot of pressure to handle. To place a canter some legislation that only makes sense.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:48.000
But the most part. We were able to run. Quite a bit handling and

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:52.000
successfully. So it was a great experience. Years

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
review. Well as an intelligence office

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
from John you're aiming

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
to intercept that night in a.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
So this is kind

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000
of consumer affairs really to crawl.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
If you use like the movie. For consumer

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:17.000
protection. You kind of middle. It's interesting you raise up

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000
like

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000
the. The most venerated lawyer in

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.000
the whole book in that office was a guy needs argument. And he was essentially the round

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.000
nadir of New

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:33.000
York. You see he would tell stories along the

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
lines. Well when I first started this work.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
I was going to call in

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.000
the judges say what the hell are you doing here what does a tenant. Attorney General got to do with

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
this private dispute.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000
And I got a call and it just says.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
How did want to talk in so long to get here. As you say has been

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:57.000
a transformation in how consumables. Have come into effect how much

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
we've taken for granted now.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
And he just goes to really an interesting point

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:07.000
to me about organizations when I was in your community actually lives in North Carolina.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:12.000
There is a relatively new I was I think in the. I don't know five six you know the

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000
most and let God I work for who have been a Peace Corps volunteer

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
and

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:22.000
Micronesia. And some advice. He

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000
says you know. In this

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:28.000
particular useful life of an organization like this. Ten

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000
years. When I was a ten general's office

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
as you say but

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:37.000
I needed

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000
to consumer protection was pretty much accepted but it was still

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:45.000
new enough that it is attracted idealistic lawyers and all

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
that all of

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.000
us. But as I

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.000
stated. It turns out in the time is named Robert pavement is Bob Abrams

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:59.000
is a really really good guy a guy been a politician's

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.000
integrity. Wonderful human being

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:09.000
he decided to run for federal office for the U.S. Senate.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
And nine hundred ninety two.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.000
Having been you know still attorney general says nine hundred seventy eight.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
His opponent was out a

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:22.000
martyr and a couple of things just just for

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:27.000
the fun of the above and I remember hearing a debatable. Of all things the Don Imus

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
show between papers and a

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000
mother and. It was awful. Because the mother was I'm not going

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000
to tack

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.000
dog. And even says had had no counter-terror just couldn't have had

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
no way of fighting

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.000
back. And he didn't help is on the Don Imus show.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Which is so used to like I really come to

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:55.000
hate that.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000
The other thing was by that

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000
point. The Office. It was just a villains who were

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000
thinking that all the office itself had begun think has in fact

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:14.000
a reporter's by that's been thinking fragile and that was partly because it's in the Reagan era.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:19.000
And the Reagan administration was not read the country from a protection of. For example.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Our office is one of the big ones in getting.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Have that instilled into

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000
come. The federal government was a quiet on

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000
that at the time. I found

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.000
that the. I guess what you call the bread and butter consumer protection cases were

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.000
just not being handled anymore. So in a in a

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.000
sense. My cause at the heart of using mediation program which. If you think about

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
was not talking mediation I was in many ways.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Acting as an advocate. As much as immediate immediate is supposed to be fair minded and

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:56.000
not take a position.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:01.000
I think we were mediated to extend that if we couldn't make. Figure out what was the right

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000
answer or before consume is wrong. We only take certain steps but if we felt

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000
the contemporary skating on we recently become advocates. So that point.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
Law idea of porn companies working things out and for me and so

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.000
on sort of filter back you can force me. That's the way I

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.000
see and I'm not sure everybody would agree with it.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
The feeling of a vacuum and you force

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:27.000
me. So I think

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000
I give my last three years attorney general's office the new

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:33.000
regional idealist

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.000
impulse was pretty much dead.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
We have to a government mentor series of three attorneys

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.000
general. One of them was a very good experience for me.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000
They thought they were out of my work.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:53.000
The last one I can say was as you can read of the song.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
John Kerry is not as

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000
nice. And

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:02.000
I didn't like how I ended up in that image. Ministration a day.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:07.000
I mention that I've been able to run the my mediation program independently at that point.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:12.000
They were making decisions about the program and I didn't consult me. Which is that Robert F.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
But it because it made me feel.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Superannuated. And I didn't want to be one of

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:22.000
those oh get a lawyer that sometimes see an organization just because they've been there for so long.

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Nobody can bring stuff to buy them. That certainly don't want to be

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000
disabled. They do it you're trying to

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:33.000
fire. Now I'm the reason why don't you know that about missing.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Spaces name is an art you think it is a great work. And he did great work for most treat.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:43.000
And there's one area where we had always been deficient in which was

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.000
mortgages to people who can really afford them.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
That's budgeting mortgages. And he did great work on that.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:55.000
So. It's not as if I've a grudge his term of office that you

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:00.000
think he used the office in a very constructive way so that point. Consumer protection.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:03.000
That Wayne was no longer the star

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:08.000
bureau. And. Yes Somebody people

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.000
have absorbed the concept of consumer protection that it's less of an even out of

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
this in the used to be always will be a need but less of

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:20.000
any Ok so. So that.

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.000
This is not what I had so I think I was unhappy with the way. My father was being

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:30.000
treated I begin to feel. And he belonged.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:35.000
I think one positive thing that are you a present you make to give it a positive I was

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
all

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:41.000
my ideas ever since I got my first time as NY. I wanted to

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
do creative

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:46.000
writing. And at that point I had enough financial

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.000
independence. And that fact they had some success in the stock market and I knew how to go

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
to market.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000
That I thought I could leave the

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:58.000
office and be really become potential financial independence.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Which it turned out that that is the case.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:06.000
So the other factor that I have mentioned about the office was check knowledge.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000
And this is really really crucial.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
So

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:15.000
or. I think I was at all physically disabled people I certainly like

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:19.000
people. Hours of a slow

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
to project knowledge and to put into

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.000
place. But for me to even slow.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:31.000
So. My lawyer colleagues had e-mail.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Gentlemen how long it was but at least a year before I

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.000
did. So I would have to do all my email work from home. I had my own

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:43.000
computer. I trained myself on computers. My boy a computer ninety six.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.000
I had some instruction from a wonderful woman emitting.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:54.000
So I was able to use it.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000
And so it took me a long time to get email. Which is a real problem and

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I was in the office.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Because crucially communicate.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:09.000
And like the other communicate your Everybody has a lawyer the bureau's my stuff.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Ultimately I thought things put in place. In terms of email. But I couldn't get access

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:20.000
to all of the systems in the office. I could not get access to the need for a database.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Because of a thing system which is Windows.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Three I think was adequate it. And the speech software put in

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.000
a

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.000
year and anybody would

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000
use it and let me for a different or this piece of it was

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000
EMS use a later version of Windows I think is ninety five in the

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000
place. And so can access

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000
to the the legal database. I couldn't access. A

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
complete

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.000
database. And I was in love with the

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:59.000
frustrated and I made an issue of this. More more I made an issue. I had huge

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
fights with our technology people which really kind of

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000
looking. And that's really why tele for

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:09.000
to me. You know. I don't mention every had fifteen thousand prison my office we have fifty

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:12.000
thousand statewide. We had to be

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.000
computerized. How technology

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000
people just did not get around to our

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000
system. Of one point some electronic. You know were doing so much work in trying

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:27.000
to get your ex accessible. So much could get paid for it on top of me

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:33.000
as a disabled lawyer who was very very frustrating.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
And I remember when I

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.000
was. Deciding to resign and I just I was actually quite angry and

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:45.000
it's not good to be that I'm very I'm not talking to a guy respected a lot he was a

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.000
senior lawyer in the office on the twenty fifth floor. Which is

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.000
executive

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:54.000
offices. I really have a problem and I can gain proper have said

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:59.000
that not. I learned another computer. And I'm you know I'm growing up

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:03.000
and I. I didn't have the wherewithal really I don't have the presence of mind to take him

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000
well actually I need a commitment to be the woman you do. I do my running of like

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:13.000
to be like you have my email you know this is all that I the blind person needs a computer.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
Never mind enough of an email.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:21.000
So that was a big contributor my side leave I was just so angry that I could not gain.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
The access that I

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.000
wanted it didn't help that they find it hard to know the blind

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.000
lawyer. About. I don't know. Months before

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
I

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.000
left. He got his vision I was a new study on its ideas.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
He was just prefer job. So when he came aboard she

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:46.000
just conceded everything that I've been fighting for and it undercut my position.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:51.000
And I can't blame them.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
But it's one of those lessons where I

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.000
feel. You. If you really really excel the job. It wasn't the

01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:03.000
job was one of you not just have it be a job really getting a paycheck. You may just have to fight

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:07.000
like crazy for certain things.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.000
But but in a way it's worked out interesting that

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.000
you know you went back to writing. Yes literature which

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:18.000
you refuse. Yes nature. Against.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And it was part of my calculation. If I hadn't helped this interest this desire to

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
you right.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
I probably would not accept the office. But

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:31.000
I know it would have been a real shame because I think the point. Remember I've been in

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:37.000
the puddle. Fourteen years I've done what they could do with it. There are other things that can be treat.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I haven't got the right to visit the offices in Buffalo Syracuse. Rochester. I should have

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
done

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:46.000
that but I was sir intent on getting all. You know what is it happens

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000
in an office either TONY JONES office or maybe an organization is a Summer time is spent

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000
in meetings and they can cut personal contact with people on the lot of

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
infrastructure you

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.000
need is not put in place public. Certainly true the ages of

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000
as I put infrastructure first meaning.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Manuals. Summaries of laws. I think that

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:15.000
out first. And then everything. Well

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:19.000
and you know.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Mediation cases. Supervising you have to

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000
work. Rejected you obviously by phone.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
So that there were certain

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:32.000
things that were nice and there always will be reasons but for the most part. I've been there

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:37.000
for fourteen years I needed something new and I was going to get on the other side. To find

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000
myself into a position. You know what happens in the law is that they say that if

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:46.000
you work in a job for more than three years you pretty much to find the top of that job.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.000
As I said the sign of a consumer protection. But if any mediation.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000
I think that's true. Yes you do it you can do. Everybody can do

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:59.000
do you. Yes.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.000
So. So you want to do you want to talk a little bit about your writing and writing. And

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:08.000
just one question before you know if you don't really

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:12.000
consider it was ignoring it formally and. I hope

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
people

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:18.000
send. Relatives. So let's talk

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:22.000
about writing. Well the first began yes.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:27.000
I have very little published I've had a few titles. I had somewhat published a

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
disability

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:33.000
that offended by here is an artist.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Published a couple of my essays in his knowledge

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.000
is. What I've

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
written for novels I've written to

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:47.000
memoirs of it and the valor. Several short

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000
stories have been some

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:53.000
essay. And I found

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:58.000
it very warning and he would I find if they want to love

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.000
the writing I love. What was at work something out of. Into shape. I'm

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.000
a pleasers ever produced to do something like

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:10.000
that but I don't want to be just stuck to that thing I really do want to be out in the world.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000
What kind of. Characters are really

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000
understood. Was a common characteristic resist.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
I you know there are lots of men was written by black people.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:25.000
And when I said lots I was saying at least a dozen I'm aware of.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
Some of the really quite

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
the. And there have been blind writers in history.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.000
I mean. James Joyce. Have a

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.000
provision. James Thurber the cartoonist lost his vision this time

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000
by and thought.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Jorge Luis Borges. You know

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Gentile. But no blood drive

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:53.000
to explore with a couple of young adult fiction titles.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.000
No low rider has written fiction with blind characters.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:03.000
That's pretty remarkable. And anyway. It may be really hasn't been published is written. I've written it.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
We haven't even gotten so you know my

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000
first novel is about.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:16.000
It was based on as a series of incidents in New York City and nine hundred eighty two run the.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:20.000
Three billion people were killed on the subway.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000
At the

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:25.000
chime the. He trains and some other Obviously you

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
have train maybe hey

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:31.000
I had no gates between

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:35.000
cars and so apparently. There are three incidents.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:39.000
But there were three incidents where it seems that the reason why people are being killed was

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:45.000
that there was this thought they were stepping into the current president that we can't write.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Terrifying to think

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:51.000
about. Now let me just say I don't want people to be able to find by this

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:55.000
because I've always taken precautions against that I would make sure that my

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000
cane tracks. The floor before I step onto

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:02.000
it and I say that. The my misgivings I didn't make it

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.000
sound as though these people to know what they were doing. I don't know what exactly happened. But I was

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.000
generally thinking to be in the cold. So why the

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.000
novel. It's based on that is what it starts on

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000
the systems and has a fourth incident

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:22.000
where a woman is killed by going to mean something. But in this

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
case like Jessica my fictional

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:27.000
case. She was pushed by

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:31.000
somebody and. The.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.000
The authorities assume that she had

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:35.000
this past and present not

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:41.000
packing. But my main character was a high school

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:44.000
teacher has a lot of misgivings about them one way or the strong more more to

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
the case.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:50.000
And he realizes that it's highly unlikely. This woman

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:52.000
truly would have actually made that

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:56.000
mistake and.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000
The novel builds up so

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:04.000
there. My hero David himself becomes a target of

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000
this

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:09.000
person. Who realizes the day was done to him all these suspects were was

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
actually

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:14.000
happened and. So in my eyes. I think of it as a suspense novel when you

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:19.000
know right from the beginning right from the very first chapter. Who the perpetrator is.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.000
And he has relations with those characters in the

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:29.000
book. And you realize Momo the some of these characters in real danger.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:33.000
Know that book that manuscript.

01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I said to several publishers and agents

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:40.000
inside. HATCH of one publishers one woman in the publishing confidential going to take it.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:45.000
But then. She was literature another publishing house or did nonfiction. So she

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:48.000
passed along to somebody else and I was into that.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000
And what I found really frustrating was that agents you read

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000
it after they read it every single thing. They say you know and that's

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000
writing those are the.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:02.000
But you need to have another stuff. You know you need to have a mystery here.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Well I mean little signal was ready don't have another suspect in it Reza tension is

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.000
about whether this person will live to have no do something more dangerous or whether you. Characters are in danger

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
and rape.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.000
So that's my first novel and.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:22.000
I have a novel. Based on my most

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:23.000
recent

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:27.000
novel is based on the relationship I had with a woman as a

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000
child I discovered I had this

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:35.000
genetic issue. Nine hundred eighty

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:38.000
three and.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:41.000
What that did to that

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000
relationship. We had TARP that when you

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
left your job at the attorney general's office that you wanted to

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:53.000
do some writing. And we spoke a little bit about the writing. But.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Let's talk some more secure the Web site.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Yes my website for all those interested is W W W dot.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000
Adrian Spratt dot com.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:11.000
That's a deal has P R A T T V dot

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:13.000
com. You know I

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000
know that's the offices of are saying. Even for several reasons some good some

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:21.000
bad. But it really was the opportunity that

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:27.000
I had wanted to and some point. Become afraid of I think. I'm

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:31.000
never walking down the same old whole way to the same office.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.000
That I've been going to for

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:37.000
the Wallace thirteen years since you know from the World Trade

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Center. And I just enjoy that walk in a chair. You know make me feel like

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000
this is my purpose in

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.000
life. And then after well you know. In the last two or three years. It felt

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000
different it felt as though.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.000
But I mean for this man I just hate myself if I don't like despatch. Don't really want to

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:57.000
the back of my whole life as

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.000
if as if it was walking down a hallway. Today's job that

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000
I know inside out. The answer of course is

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:07.000
no. So I left the

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:13.000
office. And I would say that I was.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I was forty five years

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.000
old that the known before retirement age. I had been committed to

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000
my legal career for twenty years.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.000
As well as two years a roast or.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
It's giving up a lot.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:33.000
And it was giving up all the human contact you have given that day. Because any.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.000
The responsibility. Level of status you have with any job

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:44.000
and you know in my case that that I had you had a child was just an attorney general in charge of something or other.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:51.000
So I had to abandon all that bad and I tried my suits.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000
And I was a little bit afraid that after to see most of that I get out of my mind.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:01.000
And from what people tell me that hasn't happened yet.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:05.000
So I noticed right away into writing even before I left on the idea that I had to hold but

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000
writing the four. I've got several

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:13.000
stories. Then I I

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:17.000
wrote him is producer I've since I started the opposite

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:21.000
in June you know all of us are very biased nearby to know what I wrote while I

01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000
was at the

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:27.000
office to bring two men was several short stories. Had a lot of

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:32.000
work. And I thought that investors a months ago. The years ago by.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000
I took a course with a woman and longer

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Siegel's. In two thousand and two. I don't take me about encloses I

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:41.000
feel as though

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:46.000
you. You for the patent committee that's my concern.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.000
But it seems that fee writing courses have taken to convey that yes we can make.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000
So I think one of the

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:57.000
things I sort of indicated I think and I think the first time you know I talked to

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000
him last.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:06.000
There's been no published picture in the pipeline writer's midline

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:09.000
capture with Prince.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:15.000
And not really sure why that would be. I noticed yesterday is

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:18.000
a new title and I did Congress as

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.000
the

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:24.000
blurb says. How wonderfully written it is. And so on and so forth. It's

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:27.000
another oblivious fictional period. Despite disabled person.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And it's a young adult you know I don't title.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:33.000
So I wonder why.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:36.000
Why fiction. Be published in a young

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.000
adult is on that. But not for adults.

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:44.000
When it's convulse like people and blind alters.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
I can I find it mysterious and I just

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.000
wonder if is it an unwillingness to do with the complexity that adults

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
might bring to the

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:57.000
subject. It's just one of things I found in the cost

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:00.000
of the book my rival since I left the office.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.000
And not being not having to prove myself in the same means

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.000
you do when you left the

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:12.000
office. And that's enough as according the.

01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:15.000
How it was a castle.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.000
To figure out how to walk into and

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:23.000
it was in your court room to look to the left turn in my truck and leave

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:26.000
in a dignified fashion. That was all very important.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.000
Then much a part of

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:32.000
appearances of a sighted person doesn't have to go through the effort that

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000
I did to idea in order to achieve that effect.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:41.000
But a sort of person who is trying to do the same thing

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:45.000
out of touch with the going after that to making sure they don't trip.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Making sure they were wearing the right expression not just serious.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000
Not too many not him years running a courtroom.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
I remember

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:59.000
I was under a lecture at it the

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.000
famous universe. Let's put that

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.000
way and a very accomplished. Blind Woman.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000
An

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000
academic was giving a talk.

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000
And here's another receptive audience this is about

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:19.000
disability. And I'm asking a lot of people all the public all the people your history that

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.000
disabled or. When valving working with disabled people. Family members

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:28.000
whatever. She was sitting in the audience when she was in to

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.000
just after she was introduced you got up and walked to the front.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:37.000
She obviously had mapped out there when they found.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:41.000
She started going to the. What I seen was a lecture. Because I had. I wasn't speaking

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.000
that I can take what I knew was where I was sitting. Basically and started going when I see

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:48.000
it was a lecture and.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.000
She somehow wandered off into the corner of the room and started addressing the

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:58.000
corner with her back to us and. It was excruciating. That.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:03.000
I had imagined nobody said anything I think. Well enough to say anything afterwards I may have to

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.000
congratulate all the talk. Eventually she somehow figured it out. She somehow managed to find

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000
the right

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:13.000
place and address your distracted events which is great and I trust what you can

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:15.000
never form. And it's just me who remembers

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:19.000
that initial moment. Of discomfort because I've worked so hard

01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.000
not to have those moments if I can avoid them and show it

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:27.000
happens. So these are things.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:32.000
When I was at the office. I couldn't really talk about I had checked.

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.000
I felt I had

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:39.000
to create this impression that I could function like anybody

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:43.000
else. In much the same way. And obviously that's

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:48.000
not realistic. But I think we'll. You know people can be

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:51.000
very cruel. And there's no doubt about that.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:56.000
But people are surveying kind and forgiving. And I think even though the numbers

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000
of conscious level.

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000
With. Which are making something differently.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.000
We might make a note of it that moment.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
But then that moment

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000
passes. And what we're number is a part

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:14.000
that is positive and it touched my spirits. It is with

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:17.000
disabled people. They say my

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:21.000
case. I can give another look at the station of that it's become very clear to me that been working

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:24.000
with technology. It's going to take a sip of water

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:29.000
here.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.000
I've been going

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.000
over all my own papers were having I go up and I

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000
think tonnage.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
And I think I don't know the first

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:44.000
recording. You know if there were no computers. As a type everything.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
I get everything from

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:51.000
recording. I build my own notes I have very little material in Braille except for

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.000
poetry and one of the things that

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:58.000
I I'm reminded by going to buy. I mean my the not by going through

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
these notes.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Is that I don't think it know how to spell the names of authors.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:10.000
Characters. For example in the Odyssey. Which I really look at. I was looking at this morning.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000
All these names. Some of which I

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:17.000
could spell. Like to dismiss a sort of

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:21.000
news but some here the names. I didn't know how to spell interested in how

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:26.000
to spell them. I didn't necessarily hear them right. And so is very reluctant to

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:32.000
say the name. Because it has shown making it.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:37.000
And I think I know. Now in retrospect. I'm trying to

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
mimic

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.000
sample. I know for instance of the time I

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:46.000
would confuse the gears and Victor is employed in a

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:51.000
word. And I'm pretty sure that I made

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.000
mistakes not in those lines. As I taught all the

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:56.000
time when I was using people's

01:43:55.000 --> 01:44:00.000
names and. I don't remember people pointing that out to me at all or maybe people didn't.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.000
We're ensuring that was true for a lot of people. Other people may just say you know yours was talking

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:08.000
about why make an issue out of this.

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
Now that I've got a

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:13.000
computer with my speech. Sense of

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.000
justice. It's very easy for me to spell and it

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:21.000
was so this morning is NOT GOING TO MY know it's real all these question marks I wrote to

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:26.000
myself about the spending and you know. Change the subject. Make sure I find it's up if I want the papers

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.000
I can spell it right in the paper. Now I just

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:35.000
I. I got a good go. I put in the names

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.000
maybe give us some

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:40.000
context. Like a put obviously

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Homer and then the name of the

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.000
character. And then Google. Go automatically produced.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
The rest

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:52.000
ballot and then I can check the spelling. And then you. You know. Go Vols Well

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I remember the

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:58.000
spelling. This all the different worlds and aspect like a child life.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Hiding the fact that I couldn't get names right.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:08.000
So those are things I I thought I hadn't written

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:16.000
about that particular issue I had written about. So choreography of places I call it I think about that.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:21.000
And another thing I've written about is is this is purely imaginary. And

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:24.000
I in my first novel in the very first chapter.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:29.000
It's written from the point of view of a woman who's reading her supper a

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:33.000
train and. It occurred to me as I was writing that section.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:37.000
She's a she's a professional. She's going to an office.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
She would probably wear makeup.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Now this is a woman who's never seeing.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Which brings a whole other issue. As a size. I guess and as a digression.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:49.000
Anybody in the field

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:55.000
nurses but anybody who hears not familiar with dry people probably hasn't given us any thought.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:59.000
But big big difference between people who've never seen. And people who have

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:02.000
seen is that. When you've never

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000
seen. You've never had.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:12.000
If the faces in which you can mirror back. Expression.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.000
You know when I started time I was thirteen. By the time I'm sure to even younger.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.000
I had those expressions are part of me.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
But people have never

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.000
seen. They don't have those expressions or they have to be trained in some

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:32.000
sense. They are still trying to

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
have expressed as going to say they also have no sense of color. I don't know that that's

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:40.000
true but I do you know that we have

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:46.000
seen whether we still see or don't see those of us who have seen at some point.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Don't know what it's

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:53.000
like when a person is never seeing things in terms of color.

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:55.000
What of a

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.000
matching and for them.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
What did you think I'm imagining when I'm remembering kind

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:03.000
of. That's Mr Had don't think is

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:08.000
solvable. So the way that comes out in this

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:11.000
first chapter of this novel. Is this woman's wearing makeup.

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:16.000
So I'm thinking to myself as as as I'm writing this section. So what did you think about makeup

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:20.000
what what what does it mean to her.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:25.000
And so I'd never talk I don't. I may have been I don't think I've talked to a blind woman a congenitally

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.000
blind woman about this. But I

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:32.000
imagined that it must feel like a somewhat artificial exercise that she's doing

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.000
this because she knows. It makes the right impression.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Even though she's not. She doesn't know the say firsthand what that impression it.

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
She knows is

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.000
good but why. Chemistry. I just assume that's a mystery.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.000
And yet you have to get it right.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:55.000
So she's going to be a bit self-conscious about it she kind of want one of the women friends.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:00.000
To confirm for her some way. This is got it right so I imagine her projecting for.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.000
But you have arrived at the office and. One of her women friends taking the siding just just

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:09.000
sticking it up a little bit.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000
So these are things. I'm able to get my writing.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:17.000
These are the things that I think by people in the professional setting in the. How do

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000
a world of the outside world

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.000
rather can't really talk about the things that have to be worked out.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
He's on our

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:32.000
own over the help of people who have some insight into all of this.

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:37.000
When you are writing like that for if you know. Yes if the. Did you write it on a computer.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
Yes there was a speech. If I had it you

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.000
know that's really interesting.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I had read a lot of stories and poems name poems and

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:50.000
sure because I could work. Community in Braille

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:54.000
because I think a lot before I got this piece of the size

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.000
computer problem what that I couldn't really edit and and the reason was I

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:03.000
was working. So many hours a day with readers

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:06.000
probably most a twelve hours a

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:10.000
day and and that's to do my little work

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:14.000
occult and Hoddy I

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:17.000
just I just I didn't want to pay for other Another reader and that's

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.000
probably true. I wasn't earning a lot of

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:25.000
money but beyond that I just wanted to be by myself some of the to say.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:30.000
So you know to work with somebody else. Revising one of my stories which would mean you know going to

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:36.000
and having this person make handwritten corrections. And if need be we type thing out the whole thing.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:41.000
And it just meant more time that I couldn't HAVE to myself and I really created.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:46.000
I seem to be one of those people who needs to have time to myself a lot of it.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.000
So do you answer your question.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:54.000
My first computer went hand in hand with my writing my first novel and I was not a

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:59.000
coincidence. I got the computer in the end of nine hundred eighty six.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:02.000
I guess I mention this before. That's. I

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
did a little training with a woman a man

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:09.000
day. One thirty five West. Twenty third Street which is

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:14.000
where this is a building the number of people live. And she she has this

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:18.000
training. I guess business.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Here's a very helpful.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:25.000
So what does a what you work in this business and as with a speech and computer.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:30.000
I could hear what I was actually typing. I could go back I could edit I could

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:33.000
move sentences from one place to another place. Check my

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:39.000
spelling all the things I know we have to do before. Except for the reader. And if I could do my own.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:43.000
For the difference in the world. And how it's

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:45.000
being changed now with

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:49.000
prepared. Well. We're writing or

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:52.000
just in general yeah.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:53.000
OK. So since I left the

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.000
office. There had been that being warned. Advance. After the

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:01.000
next was quite really amazing terms of my

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:06.000
independence. When I left the office. I hired someone to come

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:10.000
into afternoons a week I figured I'd need to have all my mail

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:14.000
read. I need a paper.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:19.000
With Somebody. A lot of my correspondents

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:25.000
from from friends would still have to be read.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Now. Almost all my correspondence is by e-mail I don't get any of that

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.000
anymore nobody does.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000
And of second to my own emails

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:40.000
reply. I can I.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:45.000
I think I mentioned that I need to invest in order to keep a float.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Can do all that by myself. The Their web site

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:54.000
is completely accessible to the extent that I need accessibility. I say that because

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:59.000
I don't do it options and that's a whole other issue. But even that even there are pretty there

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:01.000
are accessible. Pretty amazing to me.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:06.000
And I know what I want to broker and cite troublous the broker. Yes yes yes.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:12.000
And I don't know what other Web sites are also accessible I mean in their figure

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.000
logy of

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:17.000
the other investment work Web sites.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:23.000
So yeah it was in my book and I can do everything myself which is very liberating.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:24.000
And so the only

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:29.000
thing. The main use I have to read and now. I only have a person come in once

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:34.000
a week one afternoon. Is.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:38.000
I just have this person read back. What I'm either

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000
written or heavily edited in the preceding

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:44.000
week. Because. I

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:48.000
find. That when I listen to things on the computer think that I've

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:53.000
written. They can sound pretty good. But when everybody

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.000
human was some somebody out of Christianity. Comes out. It's very hard

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
to

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:03.000
explain this I have a ping people understand it into to play but the

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:06.000
least I need to hear their material rep

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:12.000
and every time you step back. I spend the next day to making terms of evasions.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:18.000
So you know the computer doesn't answer all the questions for me. But certainly this is most of them and it

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:22.000
means. Whereas when I left office I thought was going to be very dependent

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:26.000
on on my partner and I don't read it I would

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:26.000
have to

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:30.000
hire. That has not been the case at all pay all my bills

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:34.000
online. With one to perceptions.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:38.000
Notably hospital business. The

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000
hospital websites of a difficult

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.000
time in terms of accessibility.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:46.000
It's interesting thing with the.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:50.000
Because I have so many stories about hospitals and it's just not worth getting that.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:53.000
They're just very very frustrating.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:59.000
The frustrating for everybody. Doubly frustrating when you have to deal with accessibility

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:03.000
issues. The softer expense to get on your

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:07.000
computer with the three of

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:10.000
you suck by using the plan is the most widely used in that world order.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Well and say going up into sub process somewhere. Sockeye is called

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Jobs which was originally an acronym for job. Access with speech.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Is made by company that closes our freedom time to pick. I believe I have

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.000
brought in a long time to develop or so many years. I've been using this one

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000
for more than twenty years now.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:38.000
I believe it now costs. Approaching nine hundred dollars for the

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:45.000
original contract. Legace really expensive is that you have to buy.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:49.000
And the maintenance contract. Every two years.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:53.000
I miss paying I think two hundred dollars by annually for that.

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:58.000
I think it's every Just a price for the next one. To something over one

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:03.000
hundred. Which is a big help.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:07.000
The euro so it's not just the software you have to make sure that when you get

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:12.000
a computer it has sufficient run. Because George isn't up a lot.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:16.000
I have to have to speak. Well. I choose to have a speech at the time

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.000
this is very good. So there are other expenses.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:26.000
But they come down a lot of people who use the i Phone to.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:33.000
I think a lesser extent. Enjoyed for those.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Probably

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:38.000
have less expense and. They seem very very happy with it I

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:43.000
am not convinced and I'm really very deft i Phone your to some not really someone you can talk about it

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:47.000
with. I find it.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:52.000
Some of the operations that I do in a second. Require several steps named I just want to deal with that.

01:55:52.000 --> 01:56:00.000
I think those are there and I know that you know providing novels or even stories like pieces.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:05.000
But I think you know this is this is obviously a problem you know. So many black people

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
don't have resources.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:12.000
I and force and enough that I do. Expense is a real

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.000
issue. And people really have to struggle with that little you know I want to list of people

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
here stores and

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:22.000
we share. Tips. You know if I have a question I posed a

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:27.000
question and usually get a good answer some because of the question I'm

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.000
like that.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.000
I find the question of how do we have for the next maintenance contract how do

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:42.000
I buy this or that it really is those are real issues for black people.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:46.000
So we disagree about everything and just this morning there's a third

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:50.000
about whether it's better to read a book.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Just because it by a human

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.000
voice or whether to use

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:59.000
some. Speech synthesis application. And so people actually

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.000
believe is better with the speech that this is because they can speed up the recording to me have

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:04.000
them be able

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:09.000
to I've that's working me for of it was in newspapers like The New York

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Times which is really use it for it works for

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:17.000
a nonfiction work but the fiction works where characters are speaking they aren't

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:22.000
always. Introduced to the reader you're just you know from context. I would find

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:26.000
that really difficult and I do find it depressed tried it.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:30.000
You mentioned the threat is there like.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Groups If you want

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000
to discuss these issues.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Well I can it is this is this is it is never one clear. Yeah.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:43.000
So that's it said would be a a discussion to have on that

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:47.000
list. Is after and which way is it a specific a specific you.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:50.000
People his job. This is how we see. OK.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:55.000
It be like. You know there might be a list for People Who Cook.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:01.000
And like the list for people who fly planes into their all these lessons you know.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.000
This is because of this one is percent of the jaws

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:08.000
users. How can you talk a little bit more

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:13.000
or about. You know this technology helped you write and

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:18.000
help you communicate through technology has helped you write. Yes and helped

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:23.000
you view your finances.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:29.000
How do you do manage to do technology whether aspects of your life

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:33.000
or what

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:36.000
have you

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:40.000
know reading a position to talk about this. Only because I

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:46.000
don't use it. I've tried a lot of people now use technology

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:50.000
for G.P.S.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:51.000
technology.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:54.000
When I tried it.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Well I think I've suffered

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:59.000
this back I just spent most of my

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:02.000
life. Making sure that I knew where I was

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:08.000
so that we not only worse go to you. But how I was going to get there. So I would ask

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:12.000
people when I get you office. What throw you on who read your door in

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000
the hallway. Left right or that sort of thing.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
Obviously G.P.S. is going to help

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:23.000
that. But it can help people who are

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:27.000
unfamiliar unfamiliar returns to get from other know from a store to a hotel.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Hotel to a restaurant or living like the I understand People use of not the best.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:38.000
When I might tend to do. The tense use that

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.000
technology. I found

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:44.000
that he created by voting. There is maybe thirty feet away. Such

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:49.000
if it were next door to me. Think that that. And

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:52.000
I think I mean I think that has a lot to do with living in

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:59.000
New York City. The G.P.S. does not work as well and I remember there's a recording

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:02.000
by one of the. Disability centers where

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:07.000
they are going to demonstrate G.P.S. and it has to people go out on the street

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:11.000
is it. You know I'm standing at the corner of such and such and I'm going to go up to such and such and.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:17.000
This is going to tell me when I reach the corner and then it's going to tell me as I'm walking along this street that street.

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:22.000
Well I don't really work hard in using Jimmy was

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:27.000
really musing in a sense are you really wanted to work. And it's a shame when it doesn't. I think eyes to see Mr

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
President

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:32.000
many top buildings. There's so much radiation of one kind or another in

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
this city. But I

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:38.000
think it's probably also designed for people in cars.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Well you know the people you know I don't use it. I have actually listened to

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:47.000
the demonstrations from other places where they might be more room for

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
all it's a smaller

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:53.000
town and he does seem to help people. I could see that it be it would

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:54.000
be

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.000
useful. But a portion of the person to talk about because I haven't had a good

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
experience with it. And I haven't really needed it.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.000
But you do actually I know that you. Good around.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.000
Yes. How is that change.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Because knowledge. One great change in New York City that has this

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:18.000
is specifically New York City. Is it a noun. How long is

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:22.000
the next train to take to get to the station. And that's really nice to know. They

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.000
have sirens and sometimes are

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:29.000
those verbal enough Mr forthcoming.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:33.000
So people vision can see the signs but it is really nice to know

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:42.000
that the next train to such and such is going to arrive in four minutes. That's nice.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Otherwise known as this is my old fashioned way of actually one of my friends were suggesting that I take your reporting

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:51.000
of how I handle the subway. And I don't want to make it sound as though I'm the only one who does the subway.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:56.000
Many people do. And they don't have a different techniques. But I think

02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:01.000
if it is a strategic of something.

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Granted you know I'm at a truck Street Station in the what we call the two three line. This is

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:12.000
an express train I'm in the last stop in Brooklyn before. When Hans Wall

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:14.000
Street and. And then been in

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Russia. I mean I still do this today but in Russia particularly which I

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
have voiced now.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:25.000
I would go through the turnstiles I take the elevator down to a color the A

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:30.000
listers at the steps and steps needed to the platform. So I go through that whole bridge that's

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.000
pretty straightforward. And so I let my computer just

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
spoke to

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.000
us so

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:45.000
I made on the platform near the bottom as that's not at the bottom the steps I think I want to get in people's way.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.000
For the train to come in.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:52.000
And you know coming pretty fast. Whenever Snowden so does.

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000
And then has a certain point. I could always

02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:01.000
estimate. Whatever still moving. I could by came forward

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000
to just a side of the

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:06.000
car. And then it just belts a little bit.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:13.000
So that when it came to stop. I know exactly where the doors were.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:18.000
It was very important me to position myself right with it was going to open so that I'd

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
follow the car to the left make

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:23.000
a pencil and just for the doors to

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:28.000
open. And then going to the door get open. I put my cane.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:33.000
On to the floor of the subway. For two reasons one to make sure that it was the floor. For the step

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.000
onto a number two.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:41.000
To make sure I was going to you know walk into somebody or step in somebody speed.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:47.000
And I obviously wasn't happy open gates was a lot of people I was getting on the train. And they would

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:51.000
automatically just give me enough space to get on.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:57.000
And then I would never step onto the train and then find something

02:03:55.000 --> 02:04:00.000
to and. And you can imagine that there were a.

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:05.000
People who are really scared for me. When they saw me touching this train as it was

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:10.000
moving or step. You know it's I think pretty near the platform as now I would not stand in the platform edge.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Before the train came in

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:16.000
because you know when I'm traveling in France for

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:20.000
example if your mother. If you're on a suburban

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
train platform. Near

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.000
Paris. You will also of the A line.

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Rather Tasia very the.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000
The the pathos trains.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:36.000
If you're on the edge of that platform. In fact if you're even within a yard of that

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:41.000
of even farther away than those trains command. They have to blow you right off the tracks.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:46.000
Right off the platform under the child's father. That might happen in the subway not.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:49.000
Not problems likely but still it is dangerous.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:54.000
So I've noticed started at least a yard away from us that yellow. Rough line.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:59.000
As my guide. And then when the train was as I said when it's done I would

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:04.000
move forward in touch it but you know people not knowing what my strategy was with find that very nerve

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:09.000
wracking. And trademark expensive people and. What would be a real

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:13.000
problem. You know take some concentration to do that if somebody would see me

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
and they get very nervous. And then

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:21.000
they grab my arm and. You know what I do you do

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:25.000
I say thank you very much. Fine or. But or do I check three

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:30.000
because they're staying up my trying. My concentration.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Hermosa time. I

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
think you know most of

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:38.000
us. Well. And you know raising a hot issue the issue

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.000
of the systems and how do you handle

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:45.000
assistance. I think for another disabled people. It's a

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:47.000
very troubling

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.000
issue. It's taking a sip of water

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:56.000
here. I mean them

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.000
for maybe twenty years ago.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:03.000
There's a pop up a piece in The Times. And I think I can say the guy's name because he published

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:06.000
a guy named Jason Ivan saw really good

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:12.000
guy who worked for the American politician for the blind when it was here in New York is now with care. Dollars.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.000
And I'm not sure what his status is now.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:20.000
He was responsible as far as I know. Starting a publication called

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Access Well Rich is one of the. I will say is it the

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:28.000
preeminent online publication

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.000
for accessibility information whether it's

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:34.000
for. Computers for. I

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Phone for watches and dryers G.P.S. devices all sorts of things.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:44.000
He saw that I think. I know he would have attacked. In any way he said he wrote

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
this op ed piece.

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:49.000
In which you described walking to some intersection.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:53.000
And somebody grabbing his armies just he's he's writing about how he just rigid people

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:58.000
are not keep insisting on giving this a sense that they realize that they that he

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:04.000
can do this by himself and perforating I mean to be doing quite justice but that's roughly the turn of

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:07.000
the piece. So it happened there few weeks later

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:11.000
I was at a loyalist convention thinking.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Dinner. And another band that I knew in New York.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Michael. I knew him from North girl.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:23.000
We were talking about this op ed piece and matter said.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:28.000
You know. Jerry. I think about Jerry's resists. So it's just really we're talking to Jay I said.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:33.000
And like I said Jerry you know. That's all I meet women.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:37.000
And so you know for me. There are times I was assistants and

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.000
really clever people offer it that tries and I don't want to

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:46.000
systems. And it's really nice him people of fridge. And I say.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Slightly friendly and find dance and then

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:51.000
they leave me alone.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:56.000
It's a real problem in people are

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:59.000
persistent and they want to give you a loan.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:05.000
You know. Can you continue to be polite is a point where you just have to

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:12.000
be kind of mood and direct and say look I'm sorry I'm find go with it.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:16.000
It may not be an obvious example but one that comes to mind is

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:20.000
a stretcher. As a block a few blocks away from

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
where we are

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:26.000
now under a mystery.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:31.000
Where the Sidewalk is kind of uneven the paving

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:31.000
stones

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:36.000
are up and down up and down and say just a trickle in it. And the the

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:41.000
building learned to call it. Read the the was come in I want to meet

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:46.000
the sidewalk. The building one isn't even some shut out some

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.000
doing stuff going down steps setting

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:54.000
up so it's a block that takes for me. Some concentration.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:59.000
You know when you're walking along a block if you've got a building line is straight is great because you can pretty much

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000
follow it and keep a straight line.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:06.000
If you don't have a straight Building nine. Your best guide and

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
us even if you have a straight one. Your best guide is

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:14.000
traffic. And that's a little bit tricky

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:19.000
because it's not as if you hear traffic in a straight line when you're walking toward it.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Chuck with him to come from Yemen but it is likely used to describe business for the help

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:29.000
and traffic would seem to come from an outdoor somewhat ahead of you.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:34.000
And then go behind you someone has a different angle. And you just suck accustom yourself to how the

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000
angle

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:38.000
fields. To to

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:44.000
to. Or yourself to this notion of a straight line. You know.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Often have will happen to me for a while

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:51.000
but he used to happen all the time. People receive me as a passing by.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Just walk straight what straight was straight.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:56.000
And I want to say they were in the nation to walk.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Because when you can

02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:02.000
see you thinking. Looking at

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:07.000
some object. Ahead. It might be a building at the end of the street might

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:11.000
be. A signpost. But consciously.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:16.000
You're keeping a straight line on the sidewalk. In relation to other things around us if

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
you Clancy. You don't have those

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.000
objects to walk in relationship.

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:29.000
So you have to find some method to compensate. So in my case I'm talking about traffic. Building.

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:34.000
Sometimes it might be a crack in the sidewalk and any number of things in it or to go back and saying I

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
was always brought on history.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.000
I was not a getting this block.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:44.000
I tried to go to a good speed because I find if I go to slowly I sorta lose my rhythm.

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Try to keep the rhythm going to die.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Helps in a lot of

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:53.000
ways was a woman walking on the other side of the street obviously following me

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.000
very closely respect for make me nervous I hate being watched closely. But

02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:03.000
it's like when people walk behind me in a day. That clearly just just starting what I'm doing.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Make me they never. But she's just got is really the voice. This is

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.000
burying your

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:14.000
Because on the left. Dissipating a third coming up we're going

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:19.000
to trip. Is this went on and on and I know I know it's fine really honestly.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Really fine. So slow so fine that it will you please be quiet. I turn.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:26.000
And

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:32.000
I think she was offended. So learn I have this expression.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:36.000
Nasty Blind test. Which you mean kind of I want to get there are nasty black

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:42.000
people is one of those neighborhoods medium pleasant to people when they try to help.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:47.000
But for the most part. It just is the dilemma that I think a lot of people

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:51.000
have how do you respond to help. And in what circumstances.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:56.000
So have you have you written. If you have your fiction or nonfiction about.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:59.000
If you could read some of the situation as I have. Yeah.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:05.000
OK. Yes. It is this isn't the first time.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Why. I wish I could get this purpose because

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:13.000
this. Is this.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:18.000
In this is there's a way in which blind people live in a different

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:22.000
world and a way which we live in the same

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:26.000
world. And I think the main reasons reliving a different world to extend the

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
reader is because there's

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:31.000
just so little understanding

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:35.000
of what the differences are. And why the IP People see why there

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:37.000
are differences.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:42.000
The difference is now. Needless to say.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:49.000
You know if people understood that when a child me to walk in a straight line is just walk straight ahead.

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.000
It doesn't mean anything in itself. It's what say.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:57.000
Understand why it doesn't make sense to me. The BE FINE.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:59.000
But

02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:03.000
sometimes when I think I'm just being obstinate. I can. I can come across as rude.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:08.000
I don't The happens a lot when I know that people do community Pangea if you're under a lot of pressure in

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:11.000
any moment. If you've a

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:16.000
tired you absent always variable.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000
You know one of my. We had friends over that's

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:24.000
like. And

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:28.000
I did by going to this guy's not detect.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:31.000
That's not a coincidence or Christmas is that

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:35.000
he has been involved in Advocate you work at one

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.000
time or another for disabled

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:42.000
people and.

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:47.000
One of the things that became clear that discussing it stated. This is an

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:53.000
office in in New York City. I don't really want to can to specifics here but I want to get concepts across.

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Let's not assume New York

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:59.000
City. To promote the interests of the disabled people

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:03.000
of disabled people.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:07.000
And their function is primarily to remove

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:14.000
obstacles. I can give you an illustration of why home life.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Like the GET BY know about the point things out to you and of course that will help the people on the table

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Mrs funny that I'm having this

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:25.000
issue. In my apartment I have. I have to get an apartment I have

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
one

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:31.000
bathroom. My brother renovated if you for I moved in with a really

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:33.000
great does Venice

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:37.000
shop one of the ideas was the was. When I bought

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.000
this apartment. A big space in the foyer really front

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:47.000
doors. Right now that space is filled with a rather

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:53.000
nice cabinet of of cupboards and drawers. Which my brother built. You know.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Afterward. His the original idea there was to put a show stone in there.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:03.000
So I would have what really stick people call it but not enough. Which

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:08.000
would be useful for me because I have two bedrooms means you know two people in

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:13.000
the bathroom and same time. It also enhances the value of an apartment in New York City.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:19.000
I couldn't do it. I couldn't have been installed. And the reason they couldn't wasn't wouldn't be real church sensible.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:24.000
There's no way could be made in your chest or wheelchair accessible. That space by the five daughters will have

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.000
room to maneuver.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:30.000
In fact this whole apartment doesn't have room for. We'll chat room to maneuver.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:34.000
But I spoke to the guy who's ahead of that office by chance of a party and

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
expensive to Asian to him

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:40.000
just not not not to get him to knock in France into after might be hard for then

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
he wouldn't but just to get his reaction he

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:47.000
said you know I mean it is going to be great for you know you know to be there forever somebody else is going to move in. Well you

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:48.000
know it's not a

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.000
practical.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:55.000
There's something you just modify. Anyway that's a personal view.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:59.000
But the concept I want to get across is that their focus

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:02.000
is. Removing obstacles.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:07.000
My friends focus is on creating opportunities for disabled people.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:10.000
As an architect has a lot of contact with

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:14.000
developers. And people involved in

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:18.000
construction and. He is working with another to shrink

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:23.000
government to try to create opportunities

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:27.000
for disabled people. And it occurred to

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:29.000
me as we were

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:33.000
talking that that really needs to be the focus that if

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:37.000
you create opportunities for disabled people.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:39.000
The removal of obstacles will follow.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:41.000
It just

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:46.000
happened. And.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Just to stick that gets bandied around all the time. I don't know this is true that.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Maybe seventy five percent or eighty five eighty percent

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:59.000
of all people or blind people in employment age. I'm employed.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000
Which is obviously an extraordinarily high rate.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:07.000
So I think. My sense is that there

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
is not just this.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:13.000
This movement was creating opportunities that that should

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:14.000
be overseen education

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:19.000
areas. I mention how things are changing

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:24.000
colleges and universities and even my dad being with us that last quarter was as it was six people.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
But by

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:30.000
people. So that that's

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:35.000
my point even though I've sort of come to an end with saying it in a funny way.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:37.000
OK Is there anything else you want to

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:42.000
talk about. Well you know look I want to

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:47.000
see if you hadn't but what do you know if we don't have isn't your neck and then but now.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:52.000
You know. Well. Because it's a good good question. Well it's a question that

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:53.000
I

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:55.000
was always about about because

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:58.000
I in fact. You

02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:02.000
know there's a culture in. Have rejected in

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Canada has left the guy. He was a quadriplegic.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:11.000
And he can change I think for an hour can pave I think they were syndicated nationwide.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
The with the ones that I

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:17.000
remember was back in the hit. It's a

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
it's a

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:23.000
drawing of a blind

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:26.000
guy holding out a car. Obviously

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:31.000
packing. And the caption is. Please help.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:36.000
I'm black and blind but not musical.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:41.000
And he was you know. It is so it was so true.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:46.000
And I was so focused on academic work. And then you

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:50.000
know legal work inside. You know my hope is where essentially listening to music which is kind

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:55.000
of a passive activity. One of the nice thing since I bought this

02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:00.000
apartment which is that. For those who don't know me. Is a terrace apartment.

02:18:59.000 --> 02:19:05.000
Meaning I have terrace. I can now. Yes but you're into square

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:10.000
feet. Now have a lot of cancer out there so long I've become

02:19:09.000 --> 02:19:14.000
gardeners and. It's a whole new thing for me. And to you know what's the

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:18.000
current grow. You know the sort of miracle of tomatoes appearing.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Flowers or pay. Hearing. Lavender turning into something really special.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:27.000
That's just that's becoming a part of my

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:32.000
life. So if your

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:34.000
tomato plants are actually

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:38.000
very complete your tomato plants are actually better than mine. That's for.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:43.000
Well you know you always are upstate. So I think between being in

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:49.000
a slightly more southerly climb and on the nice floor which is high.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
It's a lot of another

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:56.000
so. Currently my notes are just trying

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:59.000
to see it as anything else I want to

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:07.000
mention.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:09.000
And it's just so ripping us kind of

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:11.000
wondering what I had in mind.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:18.000
OK Well thank you very much.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Why you made this interview really easy I don't have to suffer the people listening.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:29.000
But you have a lot to do with how it turned out well. You have a lot to do with

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:31.000
that hundred THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. It.
