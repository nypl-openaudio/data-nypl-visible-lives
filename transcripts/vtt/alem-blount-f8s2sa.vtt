"this is Monica Diaz and I am"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
"? for Visible Lives an oral history of the disability experience at 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
of the New York Public Library. Today is Saturday, March 28

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
2015 and we're at the Andrew Heiskell Library in

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Manhattan. And Alem, could, could you start off by telling us

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a little bit about your background and yourself? Well, my name is Alem

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Well, my name is Alem Blount. I was born in Brooklyn, New York. In the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
fall of September %um but mostly raised

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in Arizona and (...?)

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I went to school in Brooklyn

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
(....) Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Where I went to (...) school

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Elementary School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where I learned how to play

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the piano. But now I don't play anymore because

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I don't know. I'm gonna get back to it

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The reason why I was learning

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
piano was because it was music therapy for me

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and I love playing the piano. It's good

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
relaxation and it's good

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
meditation, and it's good for me to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
learn how to play because it takes away all the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
stress and, and 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Then I went to [inaudible] Middle School

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
in Milwaukee,Winconsin, and there

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I was in Special Olympics

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
running track and field, and I love

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I like to run and, I ran various

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I won various awards and you know went

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
different trips out of state to run for Special Olympics

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
But then I graduated from [inaudible] Middle School and went to high

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
school at James Madison [inaudible] high school in

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There I was in a group

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
called Sister to Sister, and I was an advanced

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
in my school, it was called the drill team, and I had

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
an excellent time

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
school, in high school because

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
at the end of my school year, I made a lot of friends

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
..and I was a popular girl, but I

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
was...nice to people.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I met a lot of people and, you know

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I mean around in high school. I think I miss high school

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
more now than being not in college

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000

well. [Inaudible] and I loved being in the Girl Scouts.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
for me.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
As a young

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
[silence]

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
[inaudible]

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
[inaudible]

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and years later do

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
not implement

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
broken in hours and hours and then I was I

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
was and the program will not assist and

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
from there I did a classical work. I shall now clerical work

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
. Couric And you know

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
stamping Colerain filing papers and

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
have them. I don't I would better put order

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and I just love the FACAL work

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
to me

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
because thanks to the south side of the stress away.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And it may show more focus more

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
work then so it's going

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
around in your mind

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and you know and I will restore our own climate

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
program in not getting

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
any money. I let him pay money and

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
my human human

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
resources to help

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
in a lot of employers

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
. Well they weren't acting Colerain filing

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
faxing. So I learned how to do so that will

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
work and other for now

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
. Patterns are changing the way you need to learn more

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
about good throughout who work and how to do at so

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
do and I want to do that so you

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
know what I have to do things with.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
My time I had to stand staying home and I

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
don't want my face how I want to work. Want to lend

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
money on me now on and things

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
like pay bills and I don't have a crush on

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Mom I mean every

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
child. Yeah I mean

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
he doesn't know so I don't

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
know some of the

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
you know

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
the program you know I just stayed home and let the

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
school Pierce did it I did too and our light foam

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
there appears to you know

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I was a liar. A lot of my friends in

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
hanging around in the school work in

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
a garage where the normal to what was constant

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
in a film then I continued at school these

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
days here. If

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
they thought it was a school in Brooklyn

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
so drastic college

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
but you know the school of that

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
island and then as

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I now wonder why I've been there I've

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
been there one half a

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
sixteen S the first program that I

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
will back that I don't want to live that they have the

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
station that they have a station with a knife in

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
these women to the college so none of them have thought this

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
vocational program that was going to help me out of

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
college that's now call axis We

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
had me go to Long Island

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
City the Brooklyn College and there I was and then pick

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
a college program. A

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
lot of know how this was a different experience for me I

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
was all my own I was in a different world

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
environment how to cope on my own and then how

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
to be responsible and take care that they

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
are surrounding me to do and you know I'm literally helpful

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
people there when I was in the pre-college Cup program

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I took some very hard classes they didn't know how

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
to

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
how to do that great mythology

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and hardest thing for me to do. But I'm learning

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
that I'm learning a lot of different history and

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
set it on and that's how

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
it's like Martin Luther King in roles of products

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
my don't faze me because he was all

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
about civil rights and discrimination so I mean

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
for our rights in

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
leadership and.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
It's those are

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
older talked about

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
your mom and me have

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
family here are encouraged to really finish strong

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
because I want to do something different and school

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I want to do there is something that's been

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
they have those Tahsin non-so rather test sites

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
. I'm going to do

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
more schooling. I want to go black schools.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
See if I can do the work. But

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I'm not the only finish college I wanted to go

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
that I really need to finish up finish the

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
take up of. I did finish the college prep

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
program completion

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
from that and then on to a

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
an employment program. Now listen if you know accession

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
section where you know I was

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
learning how to do

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
job skills my child with a hand

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and it was it in the right environment type environment for me

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
to them because I know a lot of job skills

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
like clerical I'll have a knot of the following

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
typing Anthony Colerain Alphabetical

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Order order. I just wasn't ready

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
to do clerical work

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
. It was not another she was a secretary

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
to being a secretary and a lawyer finance.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Then I went to the job path and the job

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
the clerical chaining are not more glaring Courtrai

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
chop chop chop

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
at the end the Hatten a less than extreme

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So it's something you have a lot of support from

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
various organisations. Yes other organisations

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
are here. Your experience with the

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
types of resources and time to

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
answer is a shift to the way

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
open sessions that I have to help me along the way. Well as

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
you see P Y A I

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
mean just as

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
that's pretty much.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
As you mentioned you think

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
you know you

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
are changed over the years

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
None of those things change I want to be I want to

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
go out to do with ourselves

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and me to do training. Now

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
jackass at the Brotherton cold factory I was

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
working in the basement. Put in

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
past some closed and pulls on hangers

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
. I've been there and I learnt how to

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
you know of the locals and put it neatly on hangers

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and learn how to put pet how to put the tags on the poles

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and you know sort the clothes at the close

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
lock the packs on the clothes that were

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
large put the taps on the clothes that was medium

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and put the past on the clothes that was small and

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
it was a really good bands for me but the

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
then Dean was very

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
awful. There is a job where I can

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
sit more on the stand because

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
they get tired of it fast and

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I just want to know that's Asli

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
fit.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Because this nation. Yes

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I was acting

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
as well. And I

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
mean well and it does affect me

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
but it has over the years

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
since I was ten years since I had to

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000

I can't I can't let heavy things

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
was worse. Yes the skull the answers.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Right here in San felt

good and that

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
no one is sick I didn't play and the only

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000

But they saw a heavy price.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Yeah I'm getting that through slowly

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
not rationally.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000

I'm better on the person.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000

the whole line but I had them ball and

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
I let the gut.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000

I like more or less

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
as a woman I mean I think I think

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
the chances for me.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Let me

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
quote me because I want to go

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
to Amazon and because I have one plane

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
the September eleventh thing happen

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
as

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
it's true. Since

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
I was visiting my

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Mom let's get on an airplane

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
. Then I asked my mom can we take the chain you know

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000
to rise. She then get up

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000
off the airplane and just have fun. But you

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
know I have my get in line. As long

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
as I'm not.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
A well planned but

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
not anymore. Since September eleventh in the

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Territory terrorists but the terrorists there's still a

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
question here about play I said and when I ask it of the

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
level of the sky and

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
then

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
you mother she

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
is amazing.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
She's a psychic chick

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
social scientists I

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
think you see. Yeah she helps people

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
and shoots her right now. She

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
she was helping people.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Yes but not to mean that

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Sue that's shown me that she can help

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000
people and still be and still be

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
the person that she has become and her life. Because

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
I know now that I use

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
adult will hire a child and see her off as she has a bit

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
off this way. Then skin couch and share

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
can certainly complain and she talk to people

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
about what's going on in their lives. China I think

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
now was good was what the good things

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
go back to and how they could overcome what they

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
do in their life and she just sit down and talk to them and

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.000
they listen. But

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
listen to them and get them thinking that and

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
a lot that I like people to be

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
kind to help people in the area

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
. Here

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
you see

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:21.000
some

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
things only help people learn

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
a lesson we more right in

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
a no I just want this thing

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
in my life like I want to help more. I

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
want to die so community

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
and. One of their barracks

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
and been more helpful to people in need of help

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
that my grandmother has many years for many in

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
the US is that I

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
like really where

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
I am. So yeah and I think

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:27.000
how

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
people Laura like it tasted like T.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
staff members and agencies

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
talk to will end up in the visuals with

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
disability and have to

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
develop a relationship. Well let's

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
not be so afraid to come along and ask both a

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000
question.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
If you were here for some

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
reason their eyes how to cheat or to talk to

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
