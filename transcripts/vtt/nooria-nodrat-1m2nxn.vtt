00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello my name is Monica Diaz and I am going to have a conversation

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with Nooria Nodrat for visible lives oral history of the

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
disability experience a project of The New York Public Library. Today is

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
November 19, 2014 and this is being recorded at

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Nooria's home.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And we'll get started, Nooria, can you tell me a little bit? 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
about where you come from?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
First of all, I want to say thank you for the opportunity

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
for...to come here and visit me and give me the honor

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to share my stories to other

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
people individuals, and give them the strength

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and energy to go on with life. And also, I want

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to extend my appreciation to library for the blind as well as

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the Library of Congress and public library for such

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
opportunity. I am originally from Afghanistan. I came to United

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
States in 1991 as a ?? refugee with my

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
father and my rest of my family.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I had a glaucoma in the past. But I was stable with

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
medication and also using glasses. I was able to read regular

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
print. Umm, however, in 1997 I

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
been attacked. By a teenager at the subway in 34th 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan. And

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
she was in high dosage of drugs and then been and 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
mentally disturbed. So I guess she took me as

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
a wrong person or hallucinating. And she

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
punch over my eye in my head. And because of that incident

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I become totally blind overnight.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
But life is always going on. We all have a choice in

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
life. We can make our life.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I have two choices in my life. I think one was to hold my

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
knee and cry and feel sorry about myself. And the other

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
one to let it go and to forgive that

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
individual who hurt me because I'm...I believe she

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
was not ? her mental stages to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
realize what her reaction will cost me.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So, I'm hoping that she will recover, from her illness

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and be a positive individual. And then I let it go and I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
continue with my life and then so far

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I'm doing

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
doing well (laughs) I'm...thank you...I'm

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
now I...uh, this year I graduate

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
from CUNY School of Professional Studies.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It's a program under the graduate, CUNY Graduate Program.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I got my M.S. in disability studies.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
undergraduate was at the New York City College of Technology.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I, um, graduated in Human Services, um, in

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Social Science, um, in two thousand nine. And in

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the same year 2009, I established a

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
nonprofit organization. That is called Afghanistan

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Blind Woman and Children Foundation. And

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
this foundation support blind children from elementary

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
to graduate high school. And also, we have a the rehabilitation and evaluation

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
services to evaluate client base of their capacity of

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
knowledge and understanding. And also, their physical strength to see if they are

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
qualified to go to college or pursue work.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
so, um, we find for them job or if they wish to go to the college

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
we send them to the college and pay for their college expenses. We

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
also help plan women who has, uh,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
health issues, whether is if it's mental health or

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
physical health issues. We send medicine

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
we send money for the prescription. We send money for the M.R.I.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
or anything else.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
. We also particular help them with a chronical disease

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
such as tuberculosis, HIV, or diabetes,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
heart disease you know is very threatening to.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
people lives. So we try to help them on that.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Umm.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
But, my background...I, uh, I born in

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Kabul, Afghanistan in Nineteen Sixty One in a

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
middle-class family. My father was Vice Minister of Board of Education

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
in Afghanistan and education was very very important

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and valuable to my family, especially to my father.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I have...I have five siblings

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and my older brother

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
his name was (inaudible). He was a totally blind individual

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
but he was very bright and very, um, smart

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
individual. He knows into 8 international languages and all.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And during the Dark History of the

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
of Afghanistan, where he was in Pakistan,he wants

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Open a school to, to help and

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
support blind people in the border of

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
the refugee campus between Afghanistan and Pakistan. So

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
he had to go to have permission from different

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
uh, group, of Islamic groups in

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Afghanistan to open this

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
school there and one of

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
them capture my brother and accusing him that he's a

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
CIA agent and he's inviting

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
people with Christianity. And so they captured my brother

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and then they execute my brother so...

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
My brother and I was very close because of you know I have a glaucoma and my brother

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
was blind too, so we have a bonding there, very deep and I'm mis him

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
terribly. Every time when I'm talking about him I can't hold my

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
emotion,but so

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I decided to pursue my brother's dream by having this

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
foundation to help.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
To help blind individuals in my native country.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And I'm very, very fortunate. I have wonderful board members

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and they are very supportive of me and my work. And

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I do...thank thank. Thanks

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I know it's difficult for you to talk about your brother

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
i know you had some

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
fond memories with him. You know, how did that, how did that

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
experience help you launch

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
your organization here. You know, what are some things that you brought with you based on

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
based on that experience.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
You do a lot of other work outside of you organization, but how did you like that Afghanistan, kind of 

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
impact what you are doing here. Well every incident and individual I

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
has impact in it, whether it's negative or positive.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I guess the hardship (clears throat) that

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I've been through, through my life

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I guess gave me in abroad that impact that turn

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
turn my life around and become a positive individual and think you

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
know that life is not always bad, you know? You just

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
you can, you can, you can choose your own destiny. You can make it

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
possible. I, I don't want to say it's easy.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Of course not, you know everything in life even when you are as a human being

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
be breathing to survive that's work, right?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
In order to get inhale and exhale, to get oxygen and

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
nitrogen and carbon monoxide so they all (laughs)

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
like work.  But we all must do it and

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I believe my experience in my life lead me that

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
I have to do it. I just must do it. I can...being

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
in awe of being just take care of yourself and being just

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
eating sleeping and think about yourself. In my opinion

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
cannot make good and a complete human being you have to

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
you have to contribute something in your life you have to give something

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
. So and I'm very very glad that I am

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
in a country that I have so many opportunity for woman

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
for people with disability we all have a right see here we have all have

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
a dignity but in a country like Afghanistan the.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Disability always heading behind the walls. This

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
opportunity is very limited. And I.E. it will

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
be honored for me to pursue my brother's dream and pursue my

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000
own good aim to want to help this woman in

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Afghanistan. Afghanistan has four hundred thousand planned

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
population which is two point five percent of the

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
entire country population and they have only one blind eye school

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
from elementary to graduate high school. India and all the entire country and

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
this school has only two hundred students. So compared to that six

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
this sticks that four hundred thousand people two hundred

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
students or nuffin. And I want to really help these people

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and also in all the.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
All entire country have only one bill and why

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
only one eye hospital and all the entire country.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So and that's in the capital of Afghanistan in Kabul

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and the rest of the regions in the country they don't have a they don't

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
have a hospital at all so they have a they have to go to see a

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
private doctor there and that one is only available on the

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
C.D.'s So in the village and in our area

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
there is no nothing there. And that's a cause of

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
blindness. There so I'm trying to change that I'm

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
trying to if you know that's my dream to one day I will be able to

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
provide a you know I clinic somewhere beside the Kabul in

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
another state or a region of Afghanistan so they can to

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
see if I care or they can receive other medical care and

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
that's that's why women are always

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
in Afghanistan are in there. In the second

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
level of the societies a man is always that dominant their

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
leader and his woman is always a follower

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and if you are being bored then if you are blind and you have no education no

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
work no nothing and being a woman and staying behind the wall

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and nothing to do and you must follow the

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
order and say to you don't do this didn't do that.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
How frustrating how difficult and stressful

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
life is for those but I know a lot of them are struggling and suffering

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
from mental and depression because they can do anything

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
they want to be free they want to. I'm sure they have the same feeling as I have my

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
you have because they are woman you know and they are like us they are not

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
different I mean biologically or a lot of are but they cannot

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
do it because they don't have the ability to do it I want to give them the

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
tools so they will be able to become free and do something for

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
themselves and this is this is my experience and

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I when I was in Afghanistan. Woman. In The

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Blank woman in our denizen weren't allowed to have a cane

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
walking cane to walk alone. Because

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
society's not ready for it right now.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Yeah. Their families their families they have to somebody has

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
to hold their hands and take them to where the year end there or the

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
doctor that was there or not staying there for all of the

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
home. We couldn't do anything and they go out they will

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.000
stop and then they will pull in all of these

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
terrible culture. I'm sorry to say that I mean I love my country

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
but I see it every culture every country has a positive culture native

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
culture and this is one of them and talk to people with disability. Woman couldn't

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
walk there because this stone the stabbing the shooting

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
the film on them they heard them in all of the was a woman she

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
has two kids and she was blind and she

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
has to give and she has nobody except ourself and her two kids.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So she was walking holding Cane one child holding her

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
skirt another witness on her arm and she was carrying can walk and

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
this throw this stone on her and they hurt her forehead you know.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
So this is this is and this is stemming for lack of

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
education because they are educated they know the

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
value of human human being know the value of woman do you know that

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
their respect and dignity for people with disability. Unfortunately this

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
forty years of war and four generational war didn't give

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
anything to have been people except to hold again and shoot

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and two countries

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
. No no I mean I want to

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
know all that you know the circumstances not that they'll vote for me

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and my my father's kind of concern

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
because my brother lost his life and he doesn't want to lose me

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
so you.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Know it's there about how your family has supported

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
. Your your goals in your dreams.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I'll play my I'm very very fortunate

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
. And then come with the sort of family my father and

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
my mother. They make sure that I raise right

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and then my father my brother who was blind so they don't

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
have any issue with my blindness on what one father my brother blindness.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
But in all my flight that I was the only one to work with the

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
family and bring enough food in the table and support the

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
children and my mom and my mother was a housewife because

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
six kids and she couldn't make it to go work and do things

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
and my father was spending most of our long hours I was life

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
working hard. You know even though he was workin after work

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
hours after five o'clock to stay in the office and do all in because he was a

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
minister of education and his job was require a lot of work

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
so he must stay there and. But both of them are

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
wonderful parents and I am my own mother passed away in one

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
thousand and two thousand and nine. Yeah I think you know I

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
miss her a lot

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
. She was she was. A GIVER. She

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
just won and gave and gave and gave and never complained. I guess I

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
get that. I don't know.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
But did both Americans of my father's very very. And when I

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
was young he was very over protective of me. But now

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
he knows that you know I am not

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
. A perceived or hopeless person

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
. So. He let me go.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
But he still wants me to call him every day in the

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
morning and evening it hit him I'm home I'm safe everything is

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
fine is is

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
he's wonderful so I'm also I have a brother all my

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
family my sister is my brother my older

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
brother you know who lost his life so they all are we all educated

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
so. My. Younger brother he get to his master to be

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
masters and one is in agriculture and one in

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
psychology in business another one is in computer the youngest one is

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
younger than me and my oldest brother was

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
is two months and one was in law and the other one was in

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
psychology and education enough and one day he was fine

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
in languages. My sister was a teacher. My older

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
sister my young and consistent was a teacher and my sister was a

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
teacher and my sister in law my brother why he was a

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
teacher. She's a teacher so. And I think

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
a show has you know something. It's make a lot of different people

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
behavior and I guess from an education and that my family to

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
become a positive to people with disability and to me

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
and my brother who are disabled in the family so

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:02.000
I'm very very fortunate on that. Yes I'm a little I

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
lost my husband in ninety nine and I have two

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
So we complete the documentary and the night of the

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
opening night of documentary I stand up

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
and I asked the audience that I am really

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
desire and hope and wishing to stop machine

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
profit organization to support children.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
And their idea and it was very generous that day and the

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
same night I raise eleven hundred dollars. I just asked them to give

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
me two dollars and the people who are wonderful so I took this

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
money in my hand and I went to my college while I was doing

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
my undergraduate at that time. I speak with the head of the

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Department of my college. Justine political witch and she was the

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
chairperson so I thought all right this is I have I want to this is

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
my dream and I have this money so I don't know if you can help me

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
to where I can go all I have no idea how I'm going to start it but this is

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
the way I have the big big big dream in my hat and I

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
think she told me OK let me talk to the president of the school and see what they can

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
say. So the he. And she was able to speak with the president of

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
my college

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
. And fortunately we have in my college they

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
have the one of the law former attorney in our

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
board in their board member. So that lady was that

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
caused to connect me with the poor borna law form

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
and then to the months I was able to establish again some blonde woman and children

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
foundation. I you spend that elegance and there are dollars to pay

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
for all the legal paperwork and I'll. Finish it.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
And I. When I went to when I went to the attorney

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
they told me you need to have. People to be your board member we need

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
a new message or no problem. I didn't.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Think too many people name these he said laughing at

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
me. This is you have a very small. You will have a very

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
small organization you can you can have a twenty eight people on your board

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
So you need to have me started maybe from you know four to

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
eight people and then then later on you can increase its

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
up and then I choose the best people there and

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
then. So one of them is one of my board

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
members a Dick Traum. They have the Victory's International

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
. So he's very supportive of me and my work and

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
every year I reraise and I do manage

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000
. To raise money for the foundation

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
so I last month in November.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
In the beginning it was yeah I finished my

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
ten monotone.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Before before this month on I write

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
I mean since two thousand and ten I raise money for that for my own

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
foundation. But before I was raising money for different charities

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
I raise money for cancer research is more magazines and raise

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
money for it please.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
So different that was my goal because I choose

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
mandatory for exercise and socializing and all but I

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
realize I can offer my. You know I can give something back

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
if I do that.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
By involving charities so desolate

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
and is

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
this organization your answer. Yeah yeah. How do you

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Well usually during the week I can't do it because I'm

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
too book but usually I do on Friday night

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.000

MORNING. They know they work out but I

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
can make it to join to the club hours because of my

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Daisy's crazy schedule I usually

So the afternoon Sunday afternoon Sunday morning and during the weekend

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
I do my training mostly.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
You know you talk too much about the

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
figurative snake nineteen

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Oh how do you make that transition.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
You did after

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
she attacked me. There was a lady she and a

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000
passenger she came and she told me you need to go to the police

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
. And just one thing I want to say you know being

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
an immigrant from other countries not knowing the law well

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
that's a little happen. I thought OK I'll be fine. I'm

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
you know I just I feel you know as I have asthma and very severe

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
asthma that I have to take medication. And number later

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
in all these steps to follow her as my

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
patient and you know asthma has a direct

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
connect in contact with the nervous system. So when you

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
become you know I was here as well as other they knew more. And I was

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Being on my asthma that I'm raising and like death and

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.000
the conductor of the train. He came and said to me now you

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
came inside Iraq a mess and I was like that he thought that I'm saying yes I'm

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.000
fine

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
. So he he chews my vulnerability as a whore

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
yes and he took the lady put it in the train and he left me there

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
without any assistant in a ding so the lady told me to go to the police and I

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
ignored that I guess I wasn't aware of it I didn't have the

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
knowledge of it and it was you know it's important to know the

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
law or the culture of the thing of it Candy that

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
you're living in and I don't know that because. I

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
was new I came in one thousand nine hundred ninety one and one thousand nine hundred ninety seven I lost my

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
sight so I went in to night when

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
I was in the morning when I woke up I feel everything dark it

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
was dark side thought is not a night day yet

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
but I don't do it and I don't see it like there. I I thought

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
maybe the ball is the light poles of so I reach my

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
hand and I feel the warmth in it and I realize

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
and I was that's it I thought to myself I scream like a

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
animal and my sister and my children they run they rush they came and

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
said what happened I said I just told him I can see it because everything is dark ear

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
what happened so they took me to the emergency room

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
and the doctor told me that I'm late I'm too late because what happened when

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
she punched over my head in my eye and the retina

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
of the nerves that sent

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
messages to the brain to see is completely damage

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
and because I have a goal a coma and the pressure of the

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
eye is just not the condition of the local mother

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
pressure of your eye always going up. And this killing every

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
nerve as it is going up. So because she put the pressure on my island of

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
punchy and depression my and I went up and that's why it caused to

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
stride the whole Gretna and then it wasn't impossible to

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
fix it. I did five operation and everything I did I

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
say OK let me maybe I will have a little bit might have a little bit site and but

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
it didn't work and because of this all

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.000
operation especially in one of my operation I think it was the fourth

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
one fifth and they the remember the put the guess he

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
called Bubble oil gas in my

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
eye to make direct enough for that so I'll be able to see it.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
But that early on that. Oil gas caused

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
infection in my eyes I was in stream pain and

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
being on my undergraduate and this college it was so hard for me

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
to focus at my studies and on the side I went to the doctor I said tell me

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
that through that I'm going to have my side they're not interested they say we cannot

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
see as we cannot say no I say no you have to at least give me some

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
some you know. Answer I need to know and then he

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
said to be honest with you we don't think so you've been a hobby of sight because

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
either you know or rather not it's really deteriorated you know and there is no

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
possibility to fix it. I says it will if is not then please

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
and I want to remove this lie is really hurting me I have so

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
much pain I can do with it I will stake in time

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
no not could be wife three or four times per

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000
day and still I was crying and measure pain and

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000
all my face the wrath of the rash here all around my eyes. All around

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
my eyes and burning like hell so I was and that's it and

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
I had. We. Decided to remove my my my parents

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
only not to do it. Everybody said you know I said if it's meant to be

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
be blind they're meant to be. You know just just

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
let it go I can I can do that. So I remove my eyes in two thousand and three

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
and then and then I have a press that it right

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000
there looks nice beautiful you know and they are like it

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
like that they call it smoky green color.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
So and this much my comments come complection of my skin and

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.000
I'm happy with it. If me

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
. Psychologically

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
I was scared so much when I was

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
lost my sight on the first week or will probably do a couple of days

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
when I'm one pulling my step in one put Nick's next

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000
foot to the next when I was screaming and put him back and say

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
to him what happened. No I'm going to hold out I'm going to fall down I couldn't

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
courage myself to walk one step forward. Because I was so scared

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
and my sister. I love her I love her very much.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
So she my older sister she came and she put

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
our hand in my hand in her shoulder and she put in the front of me she said No

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
You see I'm walking I'm following you just put follow your

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
footsteps see see I'm not following. So you're not going to follow

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
. Just just go ahead and go it and I did that and also I

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
went to New York Corvallis photo and I asked for

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
therapists and

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
. Therapy you

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
know psychotherapy and also I received a lot

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
of you know and training mobility training from commission for the blind

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
and other organization had the Jewish kid the gilded

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
than I preparing myself in the most important thing I think is

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
changing me is the decision that I made for myself

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
. It is to not to to

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
just. Accept my disability wherever

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000
I am.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
My disability is not going to change but I can change I

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
can adopt adjust myself to the my new circumstances

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:28.000
And that's why I. Did so.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
This street. Between

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000
the parties. Challenges you faced in you know where we were

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
. Where did you get support from your community

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
I mean. I see and I see first of all my

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
family support a lot and I also received support from

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
you know social services for a commission

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
for the Blind which I'm forever grateful.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
They've been very very wonderful people and helped me so much and

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
. Also participate in

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
many different activities. I saw her karate

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
yoga ceramic move Zeke and her writing

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
class and I took it Clarice. So

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
those social activities even there was a purpose is just to

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
keep myself busy is give me also another

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
perspective which is I learned skills I I know

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
the site. Be set right now as a

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
social service or a human service provider is is good to know how to

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
do yoga technique. So I learned that because of my social

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
activities. And I was in a karate

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
class and one of mine. I

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
recently lost my sight that time and then you have to go for

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
permission. I'm an Advent C.L.O. belt in karate

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
so. When I am in there I was crying for my inner to do that in

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
my to give my new key because you have to do it certain exam

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
tests they do. My mind

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
structure. His name was Patrick bright brown He was

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
a fireman. I did nine eleven and he

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
lost his life there. He was you know I always say to

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
me. Nuria you think you are the same new

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000
area you are in society we are the same no enough and chain you just lose your sight

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
that you have the right. To who you are inside of you

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:06.000
don't know that you are just vision destroy you and discourage you from

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
your work if you if you fall.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Seven times stand up for the eighth time and try again.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Never let yourself to be down but I follow

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.000
this instruction I guess I passed my promotion and I got my

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
new belt and all but this world of this my instruction.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
It's still. Haeckel in my brain always if I feel

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
down. I'm thinking about him and that's helped me to go on with

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
life. Some people you know you just don't know if you just bring this so much

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
influence in your life and just simple word Nic a

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
different individual way. And then I start to continue

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
my college and I got my dog I had a guide dog

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
and he my dog was with me for twelve years he passed away from

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
God and I swear that when his name was Yahoo.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
And. Then I got another dog and she was

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
lovely is the most beautiful dog in the world. I loved her from the bottom of my

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
heart. But she she was very playful dog

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
. She laughs she was Poppy so she was a play on things

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
and I saw it when this school came Monday following day said to

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
me she's not a safe dog for you to guide you because she's a

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
good dog but she's you know not for the blind individual

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
places. So they took my dog then I after

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
that decided not to have a dog because emotionally I get very

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
attached with my dogs they are like a piece of my heart so I

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
can lead them. So I decided not to have a dog and

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
I'm doing well with my kids and I travel anywhere with my cane.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Me I prefer subway I don't like buses because stuck in the traffic

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
all the time and then they tell me

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
where you want to go and see if you want to visit me and then they

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000
are going to come in as long as you give me that.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Now I'm also.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
One of the important important organization

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
that.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
It's a wonderful organization is the advocacy

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000

And I was part of the New York state chapter group so we were

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
in the lobby to provide electronic books

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
. For all the line individuals that are going to

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
colleges students or able to read books because the jet has a print

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
but blind people are struggling all the time scanning books on

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
this case until the page and page and page and they have to read

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
so tense got on with the wonderful

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
support of our Congress we were able to.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Pass this law now. Every publisher who

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
published books for the school for college or a school they must

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
provide electronic. Book with it with the

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:12.000
CD or in me. The format only whatever

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000
to blind people so they'd be able to download it and save it and read it

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
and study it. So that was one of our great accomplishment

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
as we did. We also. Fought

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
about the White King for black people

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
because they were criticizing the white kid is too long in which people are

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
tripping on it in this and that and we said this is the tool this is the two black

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000
people have and they're going to have it if you want to trip on its face you know a

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
consequence of this you know we can change because of

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
you or. Your the men we have to take care of ourselves. So

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
those sort of thing we work on in it and another one was about the

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
target that they have their website very

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
image a lot our image was and their website and black

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
people weren't able to access much at Target

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
in August because of this organization and if be

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
they the target has been forced to change

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
their website or web pages and makes it accessible for blind people to

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
use it.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000
So. You're done you know

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
I see you didn't work a number of scholarships and you're currently

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
working towards to great work.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
I finished my master and their fall of two thousand and

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
nine and two thousand and nine when I graduated in June not

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000
because the graduation ceremonies. Not in the window they have it and some are

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
so and so what.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
What's on the horizon for for your education.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
I'm planning to seek a

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000
job. I'm hoping if I can find a job in advocacy.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Positions or and they in human services.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:29.000
So I mean like right now I'm currently working with the

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
commission for the blind as well as with the industries where the

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
applying for jobs employment services to seek job

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Also my goal is to.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Pursue my Ph D. so I

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.000
approach at Columbia University and they have to call a vehicle

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000
college or teaching to go there and pursue my

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Ph D. in psychology but they acquired a G.R.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
exam so I have to prepare myself for the G.O.P.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000
He didn't even although I did jury examine five years ago

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000
. But every five years you have to take another G.-O. O.-D. exam so

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
I have to do it over again and then after that I will see

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
if I would be able to continue my peach tree. That's my goal. I mean

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000
for education. Yes.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
The direction of the organization.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
We do it very well we sent we sent about thirty five K.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
instable and blind children in Afghanistan into bland high school

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:48.000
.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000
We send Slayton stylus we send up a seven brave parking machines

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000
. We send them Braille embassador we said no but through thousand

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
sheets of Braille paper you know the

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:07.000
. Plastic torn off on gray paper that they use in for

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.000
special purpose is to do it for you know to draw diagrams

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:18.000
and all so we send that. In. And we are still hoping

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
that we can to help. Do they have a sports field

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
that they want to come to leave it there in Afghanistan for the children

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:32.000
. So I'm trying to get involved with the sport

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000
organization here often and services for people with disability

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000
and see if they can help us do.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000
To you know help the blind school enough Ganesan to

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000
facilities is available for them to

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
do some work with raising your children here.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
No.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:02.000
No no it's our work is over see I mean the activities the main

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:07.000
offices here. The decision on border safety here but

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:12.000
the work is legal for against I'm not against it and there's a

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.000
lot of woman some division in the state of

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:22.000
war. They call me dear Afghan but there are not enough against son

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.000
. Unfortunately we cannot help them because they're not in Afghanistan they are

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000
in other countries.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000
So yes this is not our mission and the weekend. So you know

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000
. What. What advice do you. Have.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000
For those of us. Here in the US

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:43.000
.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.000
You mentioned night you know challenges you

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000
face. You wish to do in

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.000
that situation right.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Well my advice is to first of all believe in

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000
yourself. It's very very important that you have

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:12.000
to believe in yourself because nobody know you well as you

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
know yourself.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:19.000
There was a time that I've been always criticized and there wasn't

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000
discrimination don't say oh no you can't make it she's a law

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:29.000
single she can she's not a college material she's this and that

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.000
and I prove everyone wrong because what I know myself

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000
I know that if I put my mind something I will I will get it

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:40.000
.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Ice not dancing isn't easy but it's just

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.000
I I just you know maybe some Saudi people might

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
think I'm a stubborn I guess.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Something being is several you know positively I guess how

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.000
your life think you.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.000
But then I also the other thing I

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
suggest.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000
They are immigrants and they are going to have a disability and they want to be

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000
part of you know it's important if you are in a culture of you need to just

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000
adopt learned their their way of culture learn their

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000
languages you know is necessary and to do that

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000
you need to involve the American people involved with

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:40.000
community learning it is a lot of lot of

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000
opportunities available for free. There you can go and join the

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000
libraries they all these libraries they have English language

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:54.000
classes they can take it. How do you know all of these

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:59.000
they have to already know the three tours and different places that you can go

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.000
all the Z.M. or different places to see and

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:08.000
then you learn about the culture and learn also about the language

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000
and if you learn the language and you'll be there. American people are

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000
very wonderful people they are very kind they are very they

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:22.000
brace you they ask you they help you they want to be

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:28.000
to help you as long as you be you know be

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
persistent and go on with your life and accept your

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000
disability and never be ashamed of it because this is not

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.000
something you share. I am very proud to be pro-life and I'm not I'm not consuming myself as a

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000
disabled girl and somehow everybody's disabled

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.000
if I have an eye. I don't have I am

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000
disabled. But. You sound how approaching

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000
me right now to do this interview right.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000
As not mean of you are disabled but do you need my support here

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000
. Right and I and I and this life is life is like

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.000
like a Cheney's about bond that bond that bond so nobody can say

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000
you can find anybody say Abel that nobody is able buddy

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000
except God because everybody has some kind.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Of imitation sometime and disability whether it's physical or

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:34.000
mental you know because everybody can be in the same

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.000
level. You can be one. How I'm

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:44.000
going to sit you can be. You can be one hundred percent and I

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:49.000
can be a hundred person there's no way a hundred person worked for

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000
everybody. And so somebody has to be ninety nine point

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.000
nine nine whatever. So and that's that's the way

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000
life is and I I thing you know we all

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:07.000
. Able bodied am disabled Betty should get

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000
together and make a difference in their communities and their

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000
societies and their own life and their family and

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.000
all improved a your own spirit. Because I believe when I go

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000
.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:27.000
Into their work at least at least I have something to give to the dog I say

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:31.000
God please don't put me into hell because I did something

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000
.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Something good in this or

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:42.000
that background I think you know I

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.000
I rather resent your transplant right

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.000
here right now. Do you consider yourself a New Yorker. Oh

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:53.000
yeah.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:59.000
I love New York and love me. Seriously I say I love New York because

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000
of and. The nationalities to know

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.000
is. Is that collaboration of different cultures different than we

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.000
use. I love New York because if you go down from my

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:18.000

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000
know. When I got back from Afghanistan when I came to

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.000

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:48.000

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000
has their own culture they have their own language and so is

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
the United States.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000
be me being I don't know five years or three years and four years old my

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Ph D. program and. The best of all

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I hope I wish I really really hope from

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.000
my heart that in the five years you will have a peace in this world

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000
because this war is getting crazy and make me nervous. So

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000
you know life is to short life is to you what you would not

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
believe if you're going to be surprised at how much life is I never thought I'm going to

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000
become a blinding your mind is that I ran away from my own native

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.000
country for the safety to be safe here but I don't know that I'm

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000
going to lose my sight over night and this happen. So life is

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
beautiful life is you know you need to celebrate your life I

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.000
miss now I miss the color of the flower. I miss the

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000
color of the sky. Sometime I really want to see a want to see

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
in all probably I don't know how what my grand son looked

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
like I don't know what my grandfather looked like the old woman they are beautiful

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:28.000
gorgeous kids. But I wish if I could. So don't be

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:33.000
sorry where you have you know you know. If you lost so

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
you have to think that you know if you if you don't work on it you're going

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
to lose more. So you have to work on it and go on with life

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
. That's my hope and my hope is I will have peace with the world.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000

. I'm grateful for a. Day.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
But.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I. Can't thank you enough for sharing your story. There's so much

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:58.000
more that we didn't catch or anything else right.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I want to say it was in there but my mother

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
my mother.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
When I was I think you know this is a culture custom you know when your

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000
kid. Good girl must know how to.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
How to do house chores and the boy mass you know how to

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:26.000
bring. In profit or income to the

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
family that's not that mean that they have to go and nine years old they have to study

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:36.000
but they have to know what is going to be there or they had a

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
job as an adult. They have to know this is their job they have to bring

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.000
income to the family that's it. So when I

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
was nine or something old we have

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
been in my in our home that was by I

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
guess. Has a get so my mother told me go ahead and turn

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
off the oven so you can we will cook and I told her I can do

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
this to the little I can do that she said. I know you

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:15.000
can do it just go do it I don't want to have that power in my home. You're not

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:20.000
a coward I know you can do it and so I went and I was scared

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
but I went and because when my own mother says do it

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.000
there's no way I can say no so and I

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
saw my mother was you know watching me from the corner or

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:40.000
I but she never interfere me so she she

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000
. I did. Turn off the oven then she came she hold me she

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
hugged me she told me a new area. I told you you can

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.000
do it you need to believe in yourself. And that's the

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
beautiful work. Either. However from my mother

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
I will always remember believing in myself

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000
so I tell you and through you to your aria and

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
still be a listener to the public library.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Believing in yourself is is very essential.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:23.000
It makes me Hugh make you shape your personality

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000
. He give you the you know the whole. He gave you the

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:32.000
authority to stand up for your right to know what is wrong

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
what is right for you what's wrong for you if you don't believe in yourself you

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
can do anything. Uneasy believing in yourself and accepting your

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
disabilities the key for your success.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
