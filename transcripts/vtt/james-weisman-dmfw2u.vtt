00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So this is Alex Kelly and I'm sitting here with, ah, James

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Weissman, having a conversation for the New York Public Library's Oral History Project

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
visible lives oral histories of the disability experience at Andrew High School Braille and Talking

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Book Library. It is March tenth, and I'm

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
going to start out by asking you, Jim, um, if you could tell me a little

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
bit about where you come from?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, I ah, was born in Manhattan, and grew up in Queens until it was a

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Junior High School age when I moved to Nassau County and ah

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I went to college in Ohio, but aside from that I was living in New York.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Ok.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Do you do you have any memories from those early years

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in Queens?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I remember my early life better than my current life.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I had a happy childhood and

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I loved,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I lived in Fresh Meadows in Queens. I loved it there. I didn't

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
realize that it was completely homogenous at the time, I

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
live in a diverse community at all... I had no clue. I didn't. Um, I thought I lived in

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
New York City and I was a real New Yorker and then I found out later

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in life that in fact I was exposed to very little of New York, including people with disabilities so

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
for that matter, I didn't know any. Um, but ah, but I was one of those

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Cub Scouts, Little League, school sports

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
school government. You know I did all of it. And

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I liked...I liked living in New York area when I was a kid and I took advantage of

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
you know I went to the World's Fair, and um took the train to ball

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
games, and I took advantage of New York. My parents were very much into museums. So we got

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to see them all.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Lots of Broadway. I had a kind of a privileged

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
existence that way (male). Ok. So tell me..(female). We weren't rich, but we certaintly weren't poor (male)

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
so we were able to do those things (male). Yeah (female).

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Yeah, yeah, tell me how your parents, a little bit.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
My dad was a display manufacturer. He made a

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
racks for big companies that sold bras and girdles

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and ladies' underwear and pantyhose and paperback books and

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
magazines and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
my mom was a homemaker and then worked with him for years but he died very young

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
he died at fifty-eight. So, um,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
My mother just died. She was a widow for thirty years.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Hum... But

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
neither my brother or I went into business with my dad. We both went our own ways.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
He owned his own business. We could've done it but it wasn't for us.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
us. Yeah.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So when you made your own way after after Queens. Well I was an English major

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
in college and I thought I was going to be a writer and as a senior

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
in college,  a Junior actually in college decided I should be an English teacher

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
because I had to get a job when I got out of school.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The Vietnam war was on I had a mediocre lottery number

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
so I didn't know whether I was going to be drafted or not

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I assumed I was going to be

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and when I was graduating, I student taught for a

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
while. And realized I was not

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
enjoying this. I didn't want to do it. It wasn't rewarding

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
for me and it might have been if I was more mature... but I was twenty two years old

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
my students were eighteen. It might have been if I was more mature but

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I knew I wanted to do something else. I talked to

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
my father about going to grad school for English literature

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
writing and he very gently talked me out of it.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Saying, who's going to pay you for that.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and what job will you get when you're done. and I don't know I wasn't that committed

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
to it obviously so I took the law boards to see how I would do. I did

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
well enough to go to law school and applied. and as soon as I got , you know I

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
didn't particularly care for Law students. I liked the subject

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
matter. I dove in.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
 You know right away, I knew I didn't like taxation and,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
trusts and estates, but I liked constitutional law, and civil rights things

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and there was enough in 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
the law for me there really was. And I knew I had done the right thing.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
 And I don't think it was a mistake. I'm glad I did it.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Um, I've had

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
three children, since. Two of them went to Law School

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Um,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
They're adults and lawyers. Um, I don't, I certainly

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
didn't make them go. But, I think they were comfortable

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
with the idea of being a lawyer.  They are not so comfortable now,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
actually. One doesn't practice, and one is unhappy.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
 Or, I wouldn't say unhappy but not happy. Whereas

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I, have always, while I have huge frustrations, most of the time

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I enjoy what I do. And the frustrations are substantive. Not

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
because my job is torturing me. Although, my job does

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
torture me from time to time like everybody else is. Its why they call it work and have

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
fun. Right yeah. But I do what I want to do for a living

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
living pretty much and that's not a bad way to do it. It's a luxury and

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
you don't get paid as much. and, um, when I was younger

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
younger I was resentful of people making big money and I was but

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I'm not going to lie about that but I

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I never changed what I did, and, um 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I don't feel like I made a mistake. 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
My, I still have my high school friends many of them probably ten or twelve I see

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
regularly. No college friends no law school friends. One college friend no law school friend

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
friends.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And, ah, um

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
We've all done different things, and, um, well mine is

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
unusual to a certain extent of what I do for a living. I think that my

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
friends have seen it develop and think it's normal. And they don't think

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
about maybe some kind of social crusader just like I don't

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
You know I don't get up every day and say I am a crusader but if you think about it I suppose that's what it is.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
it is.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You know all these years that's what it would be. Sometimes it's Don Quixote

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and sometimes it's more practical but that's what it is.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So tell me a little bit more detail about what you do and after law school

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
What happened?  What happened from there?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Well I was working in the Brooklyn district attorney's office when I was in law school and

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
seemed attractive to me but the city was broke.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
at the time and they were not going to hire a new assistant district attorneys because it

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
was a freeze, and, I decided, I took the bar exam

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And I was married and

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I took the bar exam and didn't have a job when I graduated.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Wondering what I was going to do and we decided to drive across the country

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And to deliver a car as a service that you

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
call him you can deliver people's cars to. A

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
lot of the West Coast. So my wife and I drove across the country

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
camping and I had a very good friend that was a

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000
disabled guy.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
We were teenagers together in a camp for disabled kids. So the story of how I got

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
there but he called me and said you want to write a grant proposal to do disability law

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
. I'm kind of jumping the gun telling you all that. But so that's how I ended up

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
doing you know work for the Legal Services Corporation which is poverty law

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
not criminal law.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
When I first started with. Hum I should really

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
back up and tell you how all that evolved.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
When I was sixteen. I'm going to be sixty four next

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
month. When I was sixteen. I

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
lived in the Harris School District on Long Island. And my

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
parents wanted me to get a job for the summer or go to homeschool because you can just stay on

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
land.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And I got to walk around I thought. You know putting groceries

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and things and I had to get a job that I could take my bicycle

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
. So there weren't that many options that seemed like a

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
good option when I showed up for work they told me that they gave the job to

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
someone else. There were none of that it was them to

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
stay put I have a teenage girl that I was hot

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
for home was working out here I had a day camp

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
for disabled kids which was bicycle distance from my house

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
. And she told me I should volunteer.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I have no desire to do it really but I have no alternatives and I asked my parents of

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
that counted as a job and they said yes so I showed up

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and from the very first day he was aware of a world I was

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
completely unaware.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Of it showed up the first day in a quadruple amputee a man who worked there who

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
became a very good friend and just passed away at the age of ninety something and now it's

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
hours Iraqi with just stumps opened up a circuit breaker

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
box and switched you know this switch on and on all of them is one hour and I was watching

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
it with his thumb thinking it looks impossible you need a finger with.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
To do the job he was doing with it you know like it needs white stone.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
How's he doing that. And I watched him do it and I watched them a few more times doing it and

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I couldn't understand how he did it

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and. I met a lot of disabled kids and disabled

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
teenagers my age who were either campers or counsellors at this

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
camp and realized it was pretty much no difference between people with disabilities

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and everybody else except asthmatic especially since these were not

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
intellectually disabled people just physically how in the name of the place was

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
abilities it was run by Henry disk already who.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
It was a congenital amputee born in one thousand twelve

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and didn't have limbs to lose twenty seven years old.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Worked with Eleanor Roosevelt and Bernard Baruch training World War

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
two entities to use limbs and Eleanor

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Roosevelt. Kind of took him under way and

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
he tried to just one break in New York City to give disabled veterans jobs

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
after the war and their abilities on Long Island and human resources school the whole place is now

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
called the Henry discarded center. And

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
. There was a DE CAMP affiliated with the school

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and I was a counselor in the camp. One of the counselors wasn't war

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
of. Genesis imperfecta which is a brittle bone

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
disease. He never left his house till he was thirteen years old to go to

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
school. He was a little older than I was that

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
he had a driver's license.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
You know and control handle when you're a teenager and you need to

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
go the driver's license it's instant and so we

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
became good friends whose name is Paul he actually became

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
president of the student body at Hofstra when he went out I think that he did

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
and. He went to law school.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And we both ended up working for the Legal Services Corporation had

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Riley when I drove to California I got a call from him that said you want to write

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
this proposal with me shortly before that it was a nine hundred

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
seventy seven. I run into Paul on the street and we'd see each other a few times a

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
year.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And Secretary California I was a secretary for

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Jimmy Carter was refusing to sign what's called

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Section five hundred four of the Rehabilitation Act of one thousand nine hundred seventy three

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
regulations which would have told recipients this was nine hundred seventy seven the law

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
passed in seventy three it was vetoed by Nixon in seventy two signed by

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Nixon in seventy three the same lot which require recipients of federal financial

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
assistance like libraries for example not to discriminate against people with

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
disabilities but the concept of nondiscrimination these of the people with disabilities

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
was some know that nobody knew what a discriminatory practice was

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
for example or unnecessary patronization.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Unnecessary protectionism. Was viewed

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
as the milk of human kindness and not as a discriminatory practice

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the result is it keeps you out of the mainstream out of the labor force. It

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
doesn't matter that it's rooted anatomists Why not if you don't get the

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
job because they think you're pathetic. Not because they hate you if you still don't get the job

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
. So it took some doing to get the first set of regulations

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
out at the time there were many disabled Vietnam veterans

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
who were lobbying for this. Revolt and then set of

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
regulations and they banded together with the disability

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
community in the first.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Kind of a. Joint effort to get the rehabilitation

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Negri division signed by Secretary Clinton. There were people throwing Purple Hearts

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
back over the White House fence and there were.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Picketing at California's house is worthless it's churchy than

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and I ran into Paul on the street right into California. Oh and I guess the

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
president relented and signed of the elations And I said hey

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
congratulations and he said What for. When I was

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
living on Hudson Street word street. And there's a bar on a cortical puff piece

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
which is still there it's been there since the beginning of George Washington I think twenty

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
years and we went to parties and we

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
started talking. And I said what you mean. How can you not be

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
excited about this. It's the person on discrimination laws with disabilities he says

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
a lot about is that a handicapped man and

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
. He said it's a piece of paper what are you talking about even my life is any different

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000
because of these papers. Now I had already known him probably ten years

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
in that time we socialized a lot so that I had been into

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
bars and restaurants and theaters whatever it is with him when people would say to me don't put him

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
there. And I would say you know purses on which I would say well he

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
talks.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And think they're jerks. I wouldn't think there ought to be a law.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
So it's a political movement or I would just think you

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
know I don't think I thought much except that they are jerks. But.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
If I thought anything it was that if they knew what I knew they wouldn't be

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
here. I'm.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Calling people fire hazard to Niles and. Because they can't get in the

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
row or that the table or you know those counties

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
That day puppies we had our first talk. That is a

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
disabled people in the law and rights.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I have never thought about this stuff.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I know that seems weird because I had ten years of experience with

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
disability I worked there three summers my whole C.D.O. in high school I did try the net

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
recreation program for the high school kids would bring in vans and have dances and

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and I have a lot of friends from there.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
But I have never had a single political thought.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Now granted there was a war going on there were students and it

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
was all kinds of political things going on around me but even that I was not a big

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I don't pay attention to the news I love the whole Watergate thing that was when I was a senior in

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
college and I was laying on the floor having thrown my back out what

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
do you mean hearings in Congress and I had already applied to was cool

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
. And I thought this is what I want to do it but I never thought

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
that. That way I had this conversation with Paul

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
. And I realize that I'm

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.000
closer to than most disability only because I was exposed

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
. To realize that exposure was the answer

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
that discrimination goes away. I've learned a lot more sense

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
about getting rid of it. That it goes away with exposure

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
. You.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Know.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
It's a blanket a big blanket statement with as many exceptions almost as a

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
rule but I think the more people see hear and know about other people the less

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
they fear and hate.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
The women's movement.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
They granted women sleep with the other half of the population so they have a huge amount of

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
influence. But even with all that influence it took millennia to change

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
the way and then think about women. Women have done. They

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
have. I'm old enough to remember when we faked it. For them to be

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
socially correct. Hong when women we're talking about

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
burning brothers. When I was twenty. My friends and I were picturing this

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
great brawlers future not women's rights. That's what we were thinking of

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
. By the time I was thirty I got it I really did

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.000
.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
I didn't just suppress sexist statements because I knew it

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
was socially incorrect. What politically incorrect.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
I knew that it diminished me as a person to say things like that. I wanted to surprise

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
. Her black people is a little different

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
but because there is so much more randomness around race and race in the nation

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
but I think that we just paralleled the women's civil

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
rights movement and the black civil rights movement in this ability there was no

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
law in this area or very little law and certainly no interpretation of

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000
that law and that a lot of case law and then a lot of courts coming down and when they did they were on the wrong

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
side a little on the long road an opinion in one thousand twenty

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
seven. Talking about why the state has the right to sterilize

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
imbecile's. Home

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
it's you know if you read it now you just think oh my God this was written in one thousand

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
nine hundred but it was in one thousand nine hundred eighty eight I think it was

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Oklahoma was finally prohibited from sterilizing repeat offenders

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
home thinking that it was genetic this was good science. All these things.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Sterilization column one of the loans that we had soldiers to lay down

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
their lives for the country or asking human missiles is that they give up the right to reproduce.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
I'm paraphrasing it wasn't that crass but it was pretty close to

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
. Home.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
People with disabilities were homebound or in institutions. There was no place for them to

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
go because everything was architecturally and it says a lot of them and even if it was accessible

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
they couldn't get because or transportation was inaccessible.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
I want to work for the Legal Services Corporation it was called Community Action for legal

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
services in New York.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
There were twenty one offices nineteen world protect truly inaccessible to them.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Although the Rehabilitation Act that I told you about before.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Require recipients of federal financial assistance to be accessible to people with disabilities it

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
was just ignored. We became the enemy of the Legal Services

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Corporation in New York while we were advocating. For people with disabilities because

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
obviously they had as big a problem as the people we were complaining about

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
. Paul was very garrulous Irish

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
guy he had the gift of blarney and.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
He was single. He spent a lot of nights. And Italians open

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
others in bars in New York and he ran into a

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
guy who stated Jacob Javits staff.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Home. Of his name was Peter Avalon.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Can't believe it but I do. I haven't thought about their

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000
guy and whether one man is making them.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Thirty years. Home we're going to point out you know it's at his

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
New York office pools that we were

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
driving you know this whole little green gremlin call.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Home it was all banged up and.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
We would rightly know it especially one time so we could park in places

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000
so it wasn't running to Jefferson's office going up Third Avenue

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
when he said what's this that made you know presumption will work

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
for us.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
I don't watch the negative presumptions. He says we're going to Jefferson's

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
office. And he'll talk to you to get on with it

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
. Then when I speak up and I'm only a certain to

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
lose you are. Still feel guilty. For underestimating me and

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
give us whatever we ask.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
When I left.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
But I kind of knew there was like you know the truth is I really did and

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
it was like it was scripted that's exactly what happened.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Exactly.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
I would say that the old thought that he had done right by people with disabilities

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
until he saw a disabled Vietnam veteran throwing the medals back to

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
California demonstrations.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
And he realized that we had to help people with disabilities.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
What could he do. We told him that Legal Services Corporation

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
which is receives direct appropriation in Congress it's agency like

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
H.H.S. for education. She said something to one of the few agencies like

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
little programs.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
They think you nothing for people with disabilities inside their offices and we want

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
to set up a wrong office. And this is the

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
traditional poor people's legal services in an accessible say it'll be a

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
really good sign language interpreter is for their people when we need them home. It will

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
provide Breland large print materials to clients and

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
it will be physically possible to workers and they will do landlord tenant

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
on Welfare and Social Security and S.S.I. and Medicaid and all those poor

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
people. Kind of issues. Great to hear

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
there was a you know he got Congressman B.I.G. from the Bronx who was on the Appropriations

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Committee that would lead services to ask what.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Are they doing for people with disabilities and they said they didn't know

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
. The people from the Legal Services Corporation who testified

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
she said well why don't we adjourn so you can find out and then you'll come back and of course they do nothing. So

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
they came back and so we have this program in New York were thinking of and that was us and

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
so we got two hundred seventy five thousand dollars from the Legal Services Corporation

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
which is like two million dollars now. I mean think about the year it was I was making

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
fourteen thousand nine hundred seventy seven he said.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
So it was fourteen. New Lloyd and I think I got a bump when the

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
bar results came in but not much bigger than fifteen pie or something.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Paul is making a little more home but both of us winning under

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
twenty thousand dollars.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Believe it or not of them it happened I went out to eat I went to a movie I had a great life. My

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
wife worked we had enough my home

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000
.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
When we open the door first thing that it was hire somebody knew that what

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.000
these women lawyers and.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
You know we thought we knew what we wanted to do go in and out of the wars so we had to hire out the worst

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
basically to live together and we did and we fired one

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
and it was weird and irony of course but we did get it done in the

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Legal Services Corporation will not let us separately incorporated. So they took our

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
money and. I'm not being unfair when I

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
say I wasted a lot of that they bought furniture for their offices with some of them

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
which really bothered me including one of them would shag carpet

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
which was like the world but of course which has a lot of logic over

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
so it was even more offensive to us because of their home and it was a poverty

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000
law office by blood tests was really it was also the fish

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
was silly to that but when you get our doors open

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.000
.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
And when we did those traditional cases came in. A

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
year but also. With people who said

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
well I won't write to me because I'm on crutches and he thinks I'm going to fall down and so on.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
My son goes to P.S. twenty six but I can't get into P.T.A. meetings

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
because I'm going to work and school is illegal. I can I

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
can get a job but I have no transportation to and from. And eat

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
all these huge systemic discrimination issues walked in the

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
door.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
So they're fascinating people fascinating people

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000
.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
So weak but I don't need to tell you about all my early clients and what

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.000
happens at home.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
I will tell you about some of the early cases later on you know how weird they are when you have

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
no home.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
But I met fascinating people with disabilities.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
One of them was a couple that came in for exams who is a

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
P.H.D. law professor at New College of Engineering

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
and she was post-polio on about.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Four feet tall on crutches and braces Swenson who was like braces and

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
had gone through her childhood to adulthood this way and gotten through college and got no

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
degrees and her boyfriend Michael Imperioli who was an educated

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
guy who was a sweetheart of a person and very dedicated to Frieda who's

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
hemiplegic from a stroke and they were very involved with

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
transportation advocacy and getting people on it.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
And. They talked me into going to a

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
hearing.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
In September one thousand nine hundred ninety seven at a hotel that was on top of Grand

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Central Station. It was even called a commoner or the more I.Q. and then

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
public lavatory.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000
And. You know now it's all

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
right that it was a different. Town

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
. And it was a public hearing for the

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
M.T.A. to get federal financial assistance. And at the time it is still the rule they have to

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
have these public hearings to seek public input and they were buying these smaller

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
buses for use on Staten Island. And a group of physically disabled

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
people who had signed up to testify to encourage

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
M.T.A. to buy accessible buses with buses for the small

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
programs in Staten Island and see how it works. And while

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
they were testifying the M.T.A. board was ignoring them

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
. They were talking to each other they were getting up and leaving without

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
saying Excuse me. You know I'm going to the bathroom or get coffee whatever it is

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
but it was like this doesn't matter and it was really clear and it was it was

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
remarkably offensive. To these people is this Ph D.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
. Who's testifying and she's being ignored. But

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
some political hack home from the front of the room I just was so

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
offended by it got under my skin and I thought we ought to do something.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
I did but you know life gets in the way

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
and I got about a year later I can remember Paul and I talking to each other.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Paul said although Clement you do transportation like we're going to change the world.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
And I did get very involved in the transit stuff at least emotionally and intellectually

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
if not legally and from that day on. I left the

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
job. In seventy nine and went to work for this new

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
program in government Kerry's office they recruited me

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
away from where I was called in New York State advocate for the disabled that didn't exist

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
before and you're going to keep the office was in the World

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Trade Center are you going to keep staying honest about

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
disability they said you're going to spearhead our attack we're going to make the world a good place to

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
be with this because we need somebody like you. Hi I had a lunatic who was

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
who only strained. Home

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.000
. I knew when I made a horrible

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
my wife who's now ex wife pregnant. With our

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000
first and I had just quit a job and I knew I wasn't leaving this one

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
so had too much one's ability and now think of twenty five thousand dollars and I have

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
health benefits have a tie and then a state employee.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
But I hate it. When we were writing this long

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
piece on the rights of people with disabilities in New York State.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
They try to put all the laws in one place because that hadn't been done and now

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
they're involved in it and we had a meeting in our

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
office with people from eastern

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Asia and the U.S. architectural and transportation that is compliance

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
board that's called the access board now in Washington the right standards

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
for accessible design.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
And

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
At some point I said in the meeting to the disabled people

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Well of New York doesn't do that issue new state doesn't do that state

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
because the states are.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
All well we had a break for lunch and.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
I. Was directing them in the World Trade Center there were express elevators and

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
locals and Sky counting rooms in the forty fourth floor and Sky lobbies

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
and these people where I will meet them for lunch I said Harold My boss wants to

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
talk to me but I'll join you. What he does he won't be joining us.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
And those dishonest home to that and those people want to live. Harold and

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
I went in his office and he started shrieking at me but he only three

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
and he said you work for the state are you counseling people to stay

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000
I said well first of all we'd be wrong if there was a mom telling them that we're doing an illegal day

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
. Right.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
But your job is and it was basically the exact purpose

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
of the comma to protect the government to keep people discipline is a way you know that

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
so I went to the men's room before we began the meeting again and I was cannot make the

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
afternoon session and he told me he was trusting me to do the right thing and I

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
said you can only trust me to do the right thing.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
To do the wrong thing you know. Before we went

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
to the meeting I went to the men's room and I'm going to tell him Oakley who is a quadriplegic Marine

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
given that. Said here are that

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
stateside while he was in the Marines.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
What are you going to do when we barely knew each other but we did notice

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.000
what I said about what he said about this job. It's one minute because we don't like it you

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
. Know it was a mistake and he goes Well if you can leave

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Terry you know just quit jobs my wife is pregnant I need

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
benefits I can't quit but if you had a job you would

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
leave.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Well the next day I got a call from the executive director of East and

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
whose name was Jim Peters. I went over there for an interview

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
He said How much do you make the first thing he said was Why do you want to do this

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
and I say.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
I am wrong and he said well you know the first thing you do if you work here

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
. I said Well since I started this work I thought we should sue the transit

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
. To make meth transit accessible to people with

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Disabilities.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
So that will be what I want to do. Those. Who are new families

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
disabled and has no way and he said then why do you want to do this

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
and I said it's the ground floor of the enormous that's about to happen.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
And I really got involved I got into it and I said and I could do this and I could be there and I could

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
and I wasn't talking about myself I should be talking about people with disabilities act like today it

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
was too late. They don't like you thought it was a good

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
idea obviously but I thought I could be of each act is what it sounds like

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
home I was unhappy with the way it came out but that's OK.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
He said How much do you make. I said well I'm making twenty five thousand

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
now because I don't want to make you mad three weeks and he

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
said. You don't take my.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Clothes at thirty. I learned later I could set a hundred he was and maybe but

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
you know he had to get better. Like it isn't any so I said

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
. OK And I said provided they had no health classes. I said provided

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
I've you know. I can't have children without

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
. And he said it doesn't you won't forget that she worked herself and

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
I'm getting help well that's why I can't come until we get these guys in service

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
connected disabled veterans getting care in the way I was the first male who could walk

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
in.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
The. Various villages there was these

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
females who work there that were able bodied to home

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
We're going to have right away

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
. I spent the first summer doing research for the trans it was he who

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000
sued them in September.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
I was twenty eight. There was

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
so touched personally I had a meeting in

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
New.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.000
YORK.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
And I kind of grew up here spent the next

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:56.000
five years doing it. Meanwhile lots of other little

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
stories and cases and every one of them was eye opening about how the

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
world who sees people with disabilities. We had a swimming pool

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:11.000
against Levittown where they wouldn't let a woman

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
who was a medalist in the Paralympics in swimming because she was in the

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
works.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
They would only let her if it is between the hours of twelve and two

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
which they considered to be low use hours. But even that she had to pass a special

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
test.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Lifeguard. We met with the plugs commission and one is that

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
we'll work with another two hundred and then Joe Joe you know I met with the post

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
commission.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Hand.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
I'm laughing at that time it is you also taught me something we were at a hearing in one Police

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Plaza touch was going to come down and he was on the Iowa caucuses long while catch

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
for that to work out how he was the only black guy on the island and this is

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
what's this got to work right up to me. Shake my hand. And that is

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
exactly what some people would take in fact his picture while rejecting the play. Yes And as

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
I told you it's because of events like this

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
implacable bag if you will cease to say it was but you know table when the

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
revolution comes just the way. He always used to make I don't

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
know where he is now.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
But. We were able to post commissionaire and we got no where

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
disabled people would be dangerous to themselves and then use that when I was in the public pools that

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
position when this went to trial that's what they

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
said.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
We challenge them on it physically disabled people be more likely to jump in what are the

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
kids women than. People without physical disabilities why would they do

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
That and why would the commission and why would why would it.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Then again it was to themselves. He said.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
I mean I have a bit against everybody else he said. Well I've probably distracted

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
. Which is detrimental to the safety of others. So we asked a very good looking

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
woman in the suits and distracting and is it just cosmetics who told me

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
a moment like that but we must take a stand and they be

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
dangerous to themselves and everyone else the public pool and I left that job and our

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
successor had to clean it up it took two years to win the.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
And there was some law in the area in New York at the time you couldn't

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.000
refuse withhold from ordinarily mission to a place of public

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
support will come to you because of visibility which is exactly what they did. It violates the

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
law on its face.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
No factual examination the facts are stipulated we don't let it in because she is

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
that.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Helen was going home I had

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
a woman who was fired from the ladies' shoe store she wanted department store

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
because she had a double mastectomy and was depressed. OK she came in my

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
office in the state.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Because when he did says those shoes

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
. So she must be told.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
So there are terribly away I picked up the phone and was sitting

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Here with Mrs Soandso you know five people for having a mistakenly right

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000
so what is it. I want to do here

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
. The cheese of the way.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Rosie chop point.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
She goes well it wasn't a mistake to me and I think he goes.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
To the cancer.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
He says yeah you know she was depressed depressing everyone around her. I thought you know I

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
felt badly about it but I thought for the greater good we

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
should let it go. Well you know she got a job she

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
didn't get the job back you know the store was not the same when they realized what had happened.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
There were things like I just posted constantly I have it here in one

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
hundred thirty fourth Street for a guy with wealth and for a

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
woman with and I say it and I said do you need special

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
transportation to get it is I can get anything and she said no I

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
. Was going to meet her out front and she pulled up in a

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
car and she couldn't park and got out of the

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
pro-marriage she she got her with a church to go out into the world.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
But on the floor in front of her. You know this sounds amazing but it's

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
true. Was her son who was pushing to get some great

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
titles then he was also developmentally disabled and not the world's most

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
coordinated guy and he was afraid to get a break for her

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
. Well yeah you know it was a

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
really really weird world I lived in was friends with a disabled couple that lived on

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
the Lower East Side I went up all of the venom a lie that the Bulls use

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
words as and when I went to the vet and there was a chair in the middle of the

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
floor.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
I could I mean I can i was it was the chair for those that use your

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
imagination.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
If you know where to go in the desert and we can get next to the

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
toilet. So he transferred from chair to chair to twelve

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
. Toilet to charity. And

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000
then there was no extensible design there were no batteries and you know there's really

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
nothing that perhaps there was no test right there was not enough and

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000
there was no awareness. No need there was a

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000
growing social security disability problem. There was a growing

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:25.000
problem. People had been be institutionalized for many

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000
years. If you remember you don't because you are young but Geraldo

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Rivera who is now kind of. A celebrity more than a

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
news person lover. Yes and he got very involved with a guy named John

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Johnson from A.B.C. News here exposing the horror of Willowbrook

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
and people realize that institutions were huge usually unpopular and

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
. Some people saw the abuse people sitting in their own feces

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
home it was all just rocking back and forth day and night. No tension.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
And there was a sensitivity to social change because of the women's movement Blackton

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
socialization movement then that normalization put people in

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
apartments could fill another table. And they

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
live in the rest of us but of course put is not free will it's

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
moving people to a different place. It's really

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
self-determination and full employment that is what was necessary but that was a

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
later.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Step I guess. And

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:43.000
. The M.T.A. case.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Was happening while these other cases were grinding their way through world as these little ones

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Sometimes legal ones. But

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
When I was a P.T.A. which became United's final Some years ago. I've

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
never left a job since seventy seven. After three

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
weeks I gave three weeks notice. So

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
this is me.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
The N.P.A. case. Rhyming its way through it I have to buy the love

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.000
from helping me that we were paying.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Through them because you like with big litigation

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
because it was a video.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Well if you make a motion to dismiss.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
And they only motion to dismiss that they don't discriminate against

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
people with disabilities that they don't post signs that say no to the

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
lab and they treat everyone even handedly

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:56.000
. So if you can get on a bus by walking up the steps of

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
crawling up them away.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Oh same thing with train stations.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
So how could a non-discrimination will require world

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Work with this guy Terry Moakley that I told you interviewed me in the men's room and I know that

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:20.000
I was a P.V.A. and he said to me what about

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:25.000
the public buildings because I never actually had a hack

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
because I was writing that thing through the governor's office but I never I mean I did not think

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000
about using you're going into and what it said was that

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
building a nine hundred seventy four and incidentally

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000
belittlement came with state of municipal funds that were likely to be used by

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
people with disabilities.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Had.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000
TO BE MADE IT SAYS or they will go terminally ill just ignore the law and no one

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
had sued using. It so we did. And

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
so I coupled that law saying that the M.T.A. doesn't have to do

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.000
anything at all. But once it's doing something.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Just to do it and not discriminatory work so the first thing is you don't have them and they will build new

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
stations but when they could be made simple to do with

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
disability according to the public buildings well and according to The New York

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
state human rights lawyer the one who told you that said you can't withhold any

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
of the privileges of places of politics the people of this birth and

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000
when you.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
But buses these are active words by day when you

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
act you have done this for a little while

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.000
by but if you know by you know that

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:54.000
you want to hear your views on the discrimination is that

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000
. They don't discriminate. I told you they let people cool

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000
and. That what I'm looking for is affirmative action to people with

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000
disabilities not non-discriminatory behavior and the law

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000
doesn't require that it requires even handed treatment went to the

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000
division and it was we lost we've healed.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Actually we won and then it healed and it was reversed in the television in a three two

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000
split of the judges three saying over a reversion to saying what is

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
nondiscrimination mean when does it need to not just going to throw

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000
all the time this is going on Cotch is opposing us.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
He said it would be cheaper to pick up people in limousines and to move buses and subways

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
except he.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Said it would be cheaper to create something like the excess of a transit program

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
. Times actually printed this time supposed us both

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000
.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Times actually printed it to pick up a bit is able to present a new study they can wherever they want to

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000
go. Should special transportation program nine dollars a year.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.000
None of that in our own right.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Certainly not for long. It was

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
primarily between Kutch and Cuomo governor in eighty two.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Almost. Lieutenant Governor.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Doesn't attend governors you get assigned important things so Governor

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Kerry assigned him to the representatives of the international year

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000
old he got involved with us a tent caught his imagination

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:49.000
especially transportations and he disagreed with Cox I think I have things to distinguish

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:55.000
from Kutch about when he got elected he promised to straighten this out for us and did

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
he call us to all and it wasn't here I had already gotten an

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
injunction stopping motivation tens of waste.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
M.J. lied and said it was that also both stations went into the

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
lowest change that I get probabilities that I got the injunction

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000
. To stop innovation then anything into the

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000
legislature.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Voted to change the law and if you didn't vote for Mr Assemblyman

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000
you know the data station in your area.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
I mean they have a lot to play hardball

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000
and Cuomo got elected and said if you get your book that's I mean

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:42.000
. You know. What. We can work it

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
out it won't work here. There were other disability groups including disabled in

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.000
action lawsuits to come after us

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000
on similar subject matter transistors and

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.000
.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:03.000
I think one of the primary one but the more the merrier when you know we wanted

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
people on the bandwagon.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000
First of all the way we met was a guy

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.000
. In development for Governor

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Cuomo. Along with the M.T.A. who came with trucks and easels and

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.000
pointers. And drawings of the most difficult

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.000
stations to make accessible. Curves stations stations that are a

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.000
little in the middle of street Southern elevators and come down into traffic.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000
How long.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
And they talked and talked and talked and contagion

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Tomoko. And I kept saying OK

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000
we're going to stay until he works.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000
And yet finished. And I said Look

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000
.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Until this minute. And years old he said millions of words as walls in

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Boston. And show you the harvest stations to do. Then I

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.000
say another telling you that are the most expensive

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.000
however you know the most difficult patients

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:22.000
. So the only issue is money. So the question is no

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
longer can weigh. The question is should weigh and

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
should we shouldn't be there decision it should be the governors

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.000
. He's an elected official is this worth or is what you're

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000
saying is it worth it is all of the type of

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000
disability. It's not new and it's always there. Hong

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.000
. And. CUOMO kind of

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.000
breathed life into our argument by saying I'm sticking with these guys and we

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000
try to make a good deal we've got the most bang for the buck home by

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000
picking stations that we're already going to be one of the most of them while I use

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:09.000
placed and saying they should be maybe sensible.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000
There's nothing that says that only T.V. stations should be accessible.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Visibilities need as much or more access to the environment than everybody else not

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.000
less but the most right thinking liberal Democrats which was all we had in New York

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
then.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Wouldn't agree to do either station it was just like expensive. If you'd see the New

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.000
York Times editorial pages if you would know that there was plenty of room to oppose us and

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000
still be called a liberal than the head of the Liberal Party in New York was on the M.T.A.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
board whose name was Steven Boger.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000
They were all these inaccessible buses three times the original

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000
purchase prior to a regulation that Jimmy Carter put out requiring sensible

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000
buses regular threw it right away so I never really had a home when

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000
he became president and they fell apart and had to be taken off the road. Graumann

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.000
flexible buses burger is quoted in The New York Times as saying if we would

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.000
have waited to test these buses they would have all had to in the military.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Because it was intelligent to buy crap part in order to deny

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:30.000
people with disability rights. So very charged atmosphere. The

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.000
left was fighting the left. There were no politicians that agreed with

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:39.000
us early on except for Ruth messenger who was a city councilwoman then

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000
borrow present and hand him in for mayor of the US to Giuliani.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000
And how. And.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000
How to see who was in assemblyman from Queens who I think is still in

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000
jail around lose control or a dead plus

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000
.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Maybe that is yeah I think you might kill him but he was actually a champion of ours and

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:09.000
I I really respected him for that one point he is

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000
much taller than I was in the. We were having an argument in his office and what were you standing

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:18.000
over me and looking down into my face and he said to me Do you realize that I get

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:23.000
real like that without a single disabled. I said Yes you know

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000
it used Democrat from Forest Hills. I know what you can hear. That's

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:32.000
plenty who view to do the right thing. It's a no risk proposition

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Certainly from a relaxed. And he said to shed.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:48.000
But we didn't have a lot of us or. All of the one who may mend it legitimate

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.000
. People thought there was room to agree with us when he did

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000
.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000
But he by June one thousand eight hundred four they had begun to order accessible

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.000
buses and the legislative session was winding down

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:08.000
. Cuomo wanted an end to the litigation the lifting of the injunction and

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:12.000
renovation of the subway stations. You know to do it we have to work this out. They brought us to

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Albany at the end of the legislative session when that happens there's like a

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Room with all its food to people who work the governor's staff on the second floor of

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000
the White House for a couple of days. They crank all the bills of the assembly in

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000
the Senate and you know it was a don't watch. So

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000
is it your political party did e-mail you know.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:41.000
Last name it is right it's a mess and they both virtually locked

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.000
us this village out of the case and here you know

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:52.000
work it out just prior to that only days. I

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:57.000
got a call from the system to the director of the M.T.A. Richard Rabbit was the

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:02.000
director the chairman of the M.T.A. I have great respect for him.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:08.000
And he thought we were nuts when people you disagree with. Him

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.000
So when people who you respect disagree with you. It's particularly

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:17.000
painful and rubbish. Thinking we were nuts was very

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000
difficult for me I liked it so I thought he was doing it for the City

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000
home of the thousands of years like Joan Rivers as mayor I thought

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.000
I really didn't care for him I thought he was too flippant to get

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000
into dismissive of people to Zulus but here we are to have a very good friend with

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
a disability. Mike that

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000
.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Disagreed with us and.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000
You know you know if he agreed with you it would change the world because it was new to

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:58.000
me doesn't then it's a huge totally monolithic thing that we kicked around the.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
World and.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:06.000
I got a call from his assistant. Not yet just resigned

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000
and Cuomo installed a new executive director. Named Kyle he

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:17.000
came from Boston. Newton Kyle the kid was

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.000
caught it was fighting axis in Boston and New York

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:26.000
. So that was his marching orders I got a call from his assistant I went to their

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.000
office. They said.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000
We're going to do. Buses.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Realize fifty percent of busses will be key stations only create I don't

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000
know and we're going to keep stations.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Is that enough. Yes it.

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Was it was a longer conversation we did more particulars and I was satisfied

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000
.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.000
The whole time I'm thinking whatever I don't get these other groups that it's

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
going to get this is amazing that I have this ability to making a deal with me and they

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:08.000
still have other was with me I won't settle for

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
. What I won't get a valve yet. We're all done

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000
talking and he says. So you like the deal

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:22.000
yet so you'll sign off on this. Yes good

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
he says get the other plaintiff's to dismiss them.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
I felt terrible I had to call those lawyers I have to say

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I acted on my own I was trying to do

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
a good thing but I made a huge error if you think about it we're getting what we asked

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
for but I really feel horrible continue out of the process

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I swear and I hug on my grave swearing although no one asked me that it

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000
was not my intention

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000
. I really thought they'd get whatever writing it and then empty it would be stupid but of course

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
small and I was miss it didn't make you do when you win you'll be our advocate. Who's that of us

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000
having to be so then we ended up in Albany a few days later

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
. Those lawyers too. They wanted to kill me but they realize

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:18.000
there's a greater good that we have to be doing and I think they thought I was

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
appropriately remorseful although I don't know how

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
. And they locked us in this room. With

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
food to the president along the way. We had we had

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.000
food and we spent two days with them today. Working it

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.000
. Out when we were going to. College was still saying it's

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.000
cheaper to have this excess arrived at program has people who can use mass

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000
transit if you need to have. So we didn't sue for that but we

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000
got it in the settlement. M.T.A. left up their sleeves and went tight once

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
paratransit Let's get it and we'll do the mast and the cuts will do the accessory

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
piece. Well that's going to take a while to make accessible but then services can be set

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
up so that we can just demand for paratransit right away because

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
. There was no transportation training going on to get people to

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
use buses where the few stations existed. Now that's thirty thousand

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000
. Four hundred sixty six hostage

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Billy. I'm sorry eighty something planned there will be

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
one hundred twenty twenty a few a little over one

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:34.000
hundred.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
We make a deal. They had a bill signing ceremony that winter in Grand Central

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Station and I have the pictures it's great caution Cuomo engine Peter's mother

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:51.000
was because we were to run to V.A. hospital is named James J. Ews

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
V.A. Medical Center because we were so active up there and getting a new building built

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
a new hospital the old school was the born on the Fourth of July hospital run covert

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000
wrote about upon the Fourth of July the Tom Cruise movie eventually.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
But that new hospital was meant to change gears. Here that it isn't because of his and our

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
advocacy to get it and to create a state of the art spinal cord injury

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000
unit so there's a lot going on around the transit stopped but the transit was my

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.000
focus. I thought I would begin doing long term care.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Issues when I finished transit thing I was kind of sick of the transit thing.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And long term care is still the sleeping giant that's going to cripple

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:46.000
this country in just a few years. My generation the baby

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
boomers will be old and will live longer than any generation before

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.000
it and it will be as manic and out as you make an authentic

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
heart troubles.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000
If it's not physically disabled. You know with

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.000
crippling diseases. Or patients or whatever happens to

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
you and there is no system set up to take care of

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:17.000
us. The should have been. Everybody knew this was coming three years ago

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
. But right now. I've gone through this with my own mothers but I really do know

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
what happens. He What have you saved.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Just spent on care. Mostly by hiring

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000
. People with no alternative to work in your home with you. Illegal

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000
aliens who don't have any numbers or people

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000
no career oldtimers their own wonderful care

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
workers and that's you know I'm just saying it's not a career path

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
. That people cite because that's what they can do

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000
. In the world they live in and you

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:06.000
have to get. If you go into assisted living or nursing

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
home spend all your assets on Medicaid eligible and end up

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:16.000
with your final use of it as a home hunted. If

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
you worked your whole life perhaps leave a mistake to your children it's gone on your

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
final years.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Just like I think it to school programs when my kids were little

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
and I was a single dad mind you know that was when I was twelve eleven and six with three children

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
and when my kids were twelve eleven and sex with Preacher with three kids I

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
didn't have to school programs and they really want to have them and I thought

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:51.000
what all these moms working there are going to be an organized

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:56.000
thing just like this public school. It's starting but if you don't like it when there

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
is my youngest twenty eight home

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:04.000
. It's starting to lay. For me I

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
think the next generation will have the blood as you seem to get it I think the next

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
generation will have it I think my generation will suffer terribly with longer than my

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
children's generation will take care of themselves. When they see of them

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:24.000
so I think that's what I was going to do and I was going to meetings at the American Planning Association

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.000
and learning this so that we can make a change in that creative

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000
benefit program that day or something I don't know what I don't learn. But I've

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.000
had really good people in Philadelphia really want us to see

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:45.000
the transit agency and you know we're a membership organization and

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I got told it basically and we see Inception. So we

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
were able to make deals with the two oldest largest

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000
rail systems in the country in one thousand eighty eight lol like the

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
senator from Connecticut and Tony quel congressman from California

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
introduced the Americans With Disabilities Act. Paul Hamm

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000
. The guy I worked with. Legal Services like teenage and had moved to

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Washington and become the executive director of the National Council on the

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.000
disabled which has presidential appointees.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Reagan was president. These were Republicans that were

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000
appointed to the council. Paul wasn't ploy so he is

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000
politics than that. But and Bob Dole was a big supporter of

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
this.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Reagan told the National Council on it was able to write a report

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
telling them.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:58.000
What's necessary for people with disabilities in the U.S. And that report

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
it was called towards independence and.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000
It was I would say one hundred days. I mean one of the things I'm

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000
guessing it's payback I still haven't. Hung. Up

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000
and it was pretty massive. And call for a wholesale change of the

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:24.000
when America does things.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.000
To elect says intellectual assistance for people that need

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:33.000
it.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
And they said. And Reagan said Thank you. Give me a

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.000
bill form. Drafted as if it was an extension

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Reagan when he got elected formed a task force on regulatory reform

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:54.000
which repealed the Transportation Committee because of that one and was has to be

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
accessible. He wanted to repeal it was called the Education for all handicapped

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000
children men not to Individuals with Disabilities Education Act

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
but. Sent a lot different. I don't want to get politically correct

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
and if you know how he wanted to repeal the regulations and lamenting.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
So it's not you the champion of disability rights but he did this thing to

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000
get home.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
It came back in the form of Lowell Weicker the only queer those Americans with Disabilities Act.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
It was introduced at the end of the legislative session legislative sessions of two years

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
so it was.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:43.000
It's like it never was introduced because to be relieved when it was

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
introduced today everybody yesterday needing time

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:53.000
to mature so it was really just getting it in was the goal.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Tony Coelho made his impassioned speech on the House floor

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000
And revealed that he had epilepsy and that he was a seminary student

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000
who was asked to leave the seminary when he had a seizure because they at the time the

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
church was not regaining.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Disabled people you could remain a priest if you became disabled but at the

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:22.000
time. There were no any of you.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:27.000
So he was bitter

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000
and somehow the politics against it. He thought they

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.000
were doing well. And he did something about it and Lowell Weicker day

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:42.000
the momentum is that.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Kennedy had a developmentally disabled child. Tom Harkin the senator from Iowa who

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000
retired had a deaf brother this is the only war that when people

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000
introduced to the above goals does it when the

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
sponsors are introduced to people talk about their disabilities or their relatives with

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
disabilities when they amend the bankruptcy law no one talked about the bankrupt

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
relatives but people think you must have a disabled relative or something to do this and in

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
fact it was you know somewhat the

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
build it up there was an election in eighty nine between Dukakis

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
In eighty eight between occultists and President Bush today said

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:29.000
President Bush has caused most of the things in the vice president but

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.000
supported the Americans With Disabilities Act as a candidate for president. Dukakis did not

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.000
take a position on the Americans. So then the disability community

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.000
held the president pushed him in his word and to his credit he kept it.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Dick Thornburgh was the attorney general of the United States. He's a former governor of Pennsylvania

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000
. He. Really was a champion on this one the as a

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000
disabled child I should say things like him very well as an adult

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:03.000
but he had been through this with a brain damaged child from a car accident

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000
.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000
And.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
He was very helpful. The counsel to the president was named Boyden Gray

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Boyden Gray was the counsel to the vice president when he was opposing us.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
You know I was the counsel to the president supporting the Americans With Disabilities Act

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000
There were no sponsors. Lowell Weicker lost his reelection. Tony Coelho did not

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000
run.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000
How sponsor became standing where it was cool in the house he

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000
was a real champion. He did it because he was close

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
and by the time it was over he was a champion in disability rights because

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000
STEPHANOPOULOS A showman was a remarkable woman a young girl and I say girl

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000
because she was a writer.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Who was bright. And terrific and had all the right things

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000
and in the. Senate was Tom.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Harkin's was his is a remarkable man

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.000
. He gets it his brother Frank was death and it's still

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:16.000
your brother still smart and he's still capable he got and he ate was a guy

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.000
named Bob is hosting was a lawyer in D.C. Now buddies from Long

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:21.000
Island.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:26.000
We actually played soccer against each other high school didn't realize until the first day when

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
that I was the transportation guy there were no transportation people on our

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000
side from transit so I became the transportation expert

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.000
but I don't I mean I'm not.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:42.000
That's OK tonight and I will keep saying that you know we need to get on

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000
with it. There was nobody. Because if you work for us we want to getting work from that.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.000
So even though plenty of people agree with us that using the main system

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.000
the system that's running anywhere. To take people where they want to go the buses

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000
running train is running well it does make it says we don't need a binder of eagles you

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.000
know made to hire new staff

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:12.000
. Who are insuring new vehicles who have exposed liability or fuel legal

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:17.000
that it's already running those kinds of people that agree with us that that's the

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
cheapest but they will not see a problem.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:30.000
HOYER And and. Harken and bubbles that was didn't particularly

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.000
and you hear this. Americans with Disabilities Act through both houses of Congress

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:40.000
. Congress unlike our state legislature the eight years an

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.000
arm of the spill it affects more than one subject matter that

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
affects places of public accommodation effectiveness

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000
plundered. So there's many committees in Congress that should be dealing with

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000
those things and all of it which is a dysfunctional mess because you keep

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:05.000
hearing on the news but at least the legislature the transportation committee would do the transportation

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
piece Education Committee would it it could in June why

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:14.000
didn't anybody on a committee this. At

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:18.000
all involved. With the bill ask about any

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
transportation was filled by controversial putting lives of us

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000
on the head of the committee was going in but Schuster from

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Pennsylvania and he was against it says a look at it as

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.000
He would say look at my knuckles there was great from pushing my mothers which I know she doesn't want all of

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
us.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Who you know we don't want to point out that she's an old lady.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:53.000
There was a congressman in Norman Minetta who spent his

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000
childhood at this place prison camp in Wyoming

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:02.000
When he was moved from San Francisco because he is of Japanese

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:07.000
descent and. He

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.000
actually became friends through the times with the way it only became a

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.000
. Sentence.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000
In Wyoming wins a Republican lie only children

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000
then this one but.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Had been the mayor of San Jose. He had an activist disability community who told him to

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
make buses because of all of the good and he thought it was the right thing to do and he thought

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:42.000
his committee chair then and how it was very helpful to us in making

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
transportation accessible. Bubba Silverstein was remarkable

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
. He took on the White House he took on John Sununu

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
who was Bush's political operative on me

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
as I was governor.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.000
When engine hum.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:08.000
He was a remarkable guy. Very very very very smart

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:08.000
.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
On our side we had a loon who works for the is Rights

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.000
Project. Of the A.C.L.U. who was the legal brains of

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000
the earth a giant looks nice but there were others who when

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
she grew up as an Orthodox Jew in New York who went to

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Barnard. Continuities that he

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:38.000
studies major and went

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:42.000
to law school. And it was a lesbian

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000
and obviously they handed.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Her hand.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:56.000
A woman Pat Wright was the grassroots

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.000
leader. Of the disabled folks in the

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.000
country. From the disability rights education and events fund in

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Berkeley California and a woman who still works for the

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Justice Department was. Working I think

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:20.000
for epilepsy. And organize the grassroots to come into Washington and has

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000
to play you know and there was a Republican disabled million in a

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000
just indoor inherited his father's money

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:33.000
. And eventually changed parties to be

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:39.000
quite influential in the Republican Party. He was all over the country at his own expense

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
holding hearings. He called hearings status

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000
where people with disabilities would come and testify about what was wrong in their communities

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:53.000
. And what needed to detect. Then Liz was able to look at

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.000
those testimonies and get those people to come to Washington.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Just and a number of years ago but he

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:05.000
. Was a great speaker

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
and.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:15.000
At President Bush's zeer and the bill worked its way through

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.000
both houses of Congress and twenty two months start to finish

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.000
and.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.000
I testified before a lot of committees and lots of those

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000
it's lovely because every committee wanted it had opinions on

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:38.000
only transportation but if you get involved with every committee answer you wind up doing

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
Judiciary Committee and

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:44.000
.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:49.000
It was very heady and exciting in one of my first days

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
to do this was Roe versus Wade day. And on

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.000
that day both. Pro-choice groups come to Washington and

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:03.000
demonstrate. And I are very early in the morning and was

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.000
behind closed lines and I got home about ten

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
eleven at night.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:15.000
And I turned on the news and there was all these women marching

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.000
right past the building I was in and I had no idea and it

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.000
became an out of work for me that they have no idea what's going on out there. We have to tell

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
her I still feel that way.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:36.000
But though it worked its way through both houses there were lots of silly

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
discussions about whether people with age should be covered. AIDS is God's will it was a

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:45.000
congressman dad of mine from Orange County California and I

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
thought it was God's will and why would protect people dying of AIDS when God wants them dead

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:55.000
. And what about kids with transfusions we'd say

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
. Well you know I once I had a neighbor

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.000
that carries a gun. We had a work party in the neighborhood to clean up the

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:09.000
neighborhood and he and I were digging a drain line together for a storm and

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:14.000
I noticed he had a holster already in the back of his pants and I said did you bring a

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.000
gun to the party and he said I bring a gun.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000
And then everybody. And I said one of the black people

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:24.000
.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:29.000
And he hesitated and my other never went one question. It took

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:34.000
one question to stump you don't you think you should be more sophisticated than that

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000
with this philosophy.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:41.000
That's what happened with the disability stuff who has that so it was debunking

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000
all the time we had a hearing with M.T.A. once where Carol

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Bellamy whose name is nothing to you but she was.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000
She she was a city council president a liberal

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Democrat. Now she's the head of UNICEF I think.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.000
But clearly a civil rights champion. She was on the board and was opposing

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000
us and I got called up to testify at this hearing and she was on a

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000
panel that was supposed to be listening to the and and so's as Richard

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:23.000
was telling you that who is the chairman and as I was walking up

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.000
. To me she said. You

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:33.000
know a member of the paralyzed and I said no I'm

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000
going to work and she said you're the lawyer. And someone

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:42.000
yelled out from the back of the room I actually know you're going to have to take a rose since passed away

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.000
. Who's the guy who had the chair and the veteran I was talking

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:53.000
about what's the matter we can hire lawyers. And

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.000
rather to give a look to Carol Bellamy like. Have you shut up.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Would you not if you keep this up we're going to get more of the fact that she

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:07.000
instead said so I can hear you if you would stand

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000
up. I could hear you and he yelled out of going to stand up I wouldn't have to be here

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
. And it went like that. So when we were

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
doing.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Yes You know this kind of thing has happened over and over and over again in congressional

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:29.000
offices both with staff and

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
with.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.000
The elected officials themselves. Congressman Dingell from

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Michigan. He's from Detroit.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:47.000
I believe it was based on an episode of the T.V. show it was about Tourette's

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Syndrome. That's what I've heard there was a lawyer who was brilliant in the firm

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000
who screamed out obscenity uncontrollably because of threats.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:02.000
And it cost him clients or something in big

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.000
track Appropriation Committee he didn't want any of those people with Tourettes on Amtrak so he wanted

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.000
to change the definition of visibility in the act to beyond the physical disability.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:18.000
We've got a bunch of disabled people to call Ingles office from Michigan and say

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
don't do this because we need mental illness and intellectual disabilities covered

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.000
and he was furious with us for doing that.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.000
But he influenced they influenced him to.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:36.000
But it wasn't a done deal. We've got

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:41.000
the president whose name was Claytor to go see Dingle in kinder

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.000
and of course there from Hong you know Washington

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000
friendly yet to too. Cold legally to need that kind of protection

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.000
that he did. He said we don't put people of the plains of the disabled because you're

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
dangerous and disruptive Iraq to train and if you're black and you dangerous and disruptive you roll up

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:05.000
can we throw you out because you're black we should be sued. And we should lose. But

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:10.000
we don't do that and we want good people will complain. Because that is a word we don't

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000
need to thank you and then one of the staffers.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:19.000
Said. Not in the congressman's presence what about people who do

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.000
this. What about people who

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
would you want to interact and end up sitting next to one of those people who eat healthy

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000
we giggled uncomfortably and smiled and I said yes he said you would

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.000
. Yes of the hive only seen them once or twice and I do this work all the

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000
time for only two hundred bucks you get to go to

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:49.000
Chicago and go way out of the world.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000
So the bill worked its way through all the committees. There was an

01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.000
amendment introduced to exempt food handling industry because of these

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000
. Two having industries an enormous industry

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000
from farming to survey you know airplane flights would

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:15.000
have been ridiculous exemptions since no one can get food aid from food. But

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000
remember everybody dies from AIDS in those days.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
It was scary.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Home.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.000
C.D.C. the Centers for Disease Control told Congress they didn't know what they were doing but

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
it didn't matter they were putting this. Thing passed. But to actually

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:38.000
get voted on. There's an amendment to

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Jessie Holmes who was rightly or anti-civil rights guy in

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Congress introduced an amendment which they get this

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:53.000
which changed the definition. Of the mission of visibility to

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:58.000
exclude sexual identity disorders almost as well if they want to

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.000
be considered disabled. But so it wasn't all that controversial but it was in that kind of the

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000
idea of you know this. Never

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000
feel you will still have a disability so if your disability was they slept with their family was

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
stuck.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.000
But none of this was necessary because unlike other discrimination disability

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000
discrimination is sometimes job related so that a quadruple amputee

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:28.000
camp is that he's honest even with reasonable accommodation and the beauty of it

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.000
here by the way which we can talk about is that it defines a discriminatory practice as the

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.000
failure to reasonably accommodate. So you want reasonable per

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
se you know it's nice that you have that coin

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:47.000
that framework built into the statute. So just treating people even handedly like

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:52.000
M.T.A. are all brought our case was not enough you have to make accommodations.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Those.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Worked its way through Congress and in one thousand nine hundred July

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:08.000
there was going to be a signing ceremony on July twenty sixth. It

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
was because I thought it might be coming to see me when I wanted it

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:17.000
. And I was taught it and this is

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:22.000
pretty internet increase of long so I got one phone call that said go to the White

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.000
House in July twenty sixth at this time and I expected to be in the room if you just saw is

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:32.000
there a little bit with the president of United States. What's inside of them

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.000
and I thought this is something I've

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
. Done it and I flew from

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Nantucket to Boston and from Boston the watching the game take you know

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000
what. And in those days you could drive up the driveway that leads to the front of the building

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.000
and I did and they told me I had to go around to the south lawn in the back

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:00.000
when a man on the back and in an instant.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I saw thousands of people with disabilities on the west lawn. Platform set

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:10.000
up in front of them.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:15.000
And I realized just how insane is that you and I actually are and how many

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:20.000
generations of people with disabilities have lived and died to make this

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
possible and how significant it really was.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
Up until then the.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Bills that he was going to be significant to me. Home and for

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:37.000
me and in that instant I don't mean minute I mean instead I realize that

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:42.000
I was like riding the crest of some way that was going to come in you know

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000
that good ideas just happen and I'm lucky to be part of it. I'm riding the

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:52.000
crest of the actual way that's going to bring me a DA in but it's all these

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.000
people and it's all his lies lived and living that made it

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:01.000
happen and all the relatives and caregivers and supporters and all the people who really

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:06.000
got that question pushed and pushed so many years.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.000
And.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:14.000
President Bush got up there with you know significant disabled Republicans which

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
included this guy just indoor with and change parties.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:24.000
If you remember the Newt Gingrich Republicans it was just and

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
good change parties when they were so reactionary.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.000
As one when in the Gingrich years Senate Bill one hundred ninety four first

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:42.000
bill introduced was to repeal big sections of the home

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.000
. But we then went to the ghost

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
hunting and afterwards there was a big party on the Ellipse find a way

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:59.000
very savage introduce you to me. Committee I'd just like one of the

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000
things and she said Senate candidates Jim was he testified at the

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.000
G.G. of course he says How are you. I said well you know

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I just flew down from the target I was on vacation and

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:19.000
we sailed past. The ends poor I saw the tents set up

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:24.000
for you. Mother wrote a book and he stopped and I

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:29.000
thought well we have the kids you know we were laughing but

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000
you know it was B.S. It was now friends with his son by the way take a

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:42.000
who's an amputee himself twelve years old it was to lead to cancer.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:54.000
When we last had a bill signing up on the podium was these disabled

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Republicans with the president. Home and the president signed a letter of

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:04.000
his name in the initial stages and there's a lot of hands that are souvenirs

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:09.000
and he was passing them out. And people will

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.000
want to you know to get one and one of the guys up on the podium with the name of the Reverend

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Harold Wilkie who if you look at that famous photograph of President Bush I mean

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:23.000
. Look he's in it and so it was just indoors

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000
. And yes no

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:33.000
arms at all. He's a bilateral amputee at the shoulder and

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
then he stepped up to get his pen.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
When President Bush held it up and he was sitting down and he

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:46.000
was standing up and rebellious looked up to where the forward

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Tenet is foot with a sock on and stuck it in his breast pocket

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:56.000
and it's almost an impossibility but I saw That's my note

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:01.000
home it's one of those things that people who eat with their feet can go

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:07.000
all of us were affected by it in those instant Kadian Tappenden

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:12.000
and hundreds of famous picture of it which is copyrighted by the New York Times

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.000
and of course you two hundred fifty dollars to use it every day that I've used it once kids are

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:22.000
home for the twentieth anniversary that year we do think of the constitutions

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Philadelphia and I include it in a slideshow

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:32.000
but they should. Make it publicly that really started

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:32.000
today.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:41.000
But all of us are moved by it it's a great metaphor for the disability experience I don't

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.000
think because you can't do it they can't do it and I don't think that it can't be

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.000
done and there will be people with disabilities put themselves in positions where they

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:55.000
know they will fail. Like jumping in what are they kids women who are lining up to

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:00.000
take a pay and they can't receive. But of course all that was an

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.000
instantaneous little metaphor. I know that everyone felt that way except perhaps to

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
dangle staffer who said what are the people who feel he was thinking

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:15.000
but those not even signed yet one of those guys who leads with the feelings of the president what what's the

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:20.000
world coming to. But I think everybody was pretty moved by the whole thing the celebration was

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:25.000
remarkable banned from the celebration at the White House was hyped along

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000
the legal brains of the outfit because she was the head of the

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:35.000
AIDS Rights Project of the A.C.L.U. and if you remember there was an expression

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000
a card carrying member of the A.C.L.U. like it's the communist party

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.000
and she was not going to spiral aboard which I

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000
have always thought was the polls.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:54.000
She's now media see commissioner she was a vessel that travels for

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:57.000
one hundred years and is now law.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Commissioner will equal to the commission an easy one.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Still brilliant. Still fighting the good fight

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
. Hone. The first draft of

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:16.000
the National Council was able was a wanted Bob Geldof. He

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:20.000
teaches at the District of Columbia College or is it is tough

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000
.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:25.000
On many of the people involved in all those that there is a way

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:31.000
that you know weakness because we get to tell the story of work there is a way you

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Know the whole story of course is all those lives. Countless

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.000
disabled people drove their car with a broom to push the guest

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:47.000
room for the breakdown and stewed with their knees and you know there's

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:52.000
all kinds of stories like that of people.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:57.000
Who work and love then what a low down

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000
home just a lost in the sauce and we don't pay any attention to

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:03.000
them.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000
There's never going to be statues built to disability rights

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:15.000
pioneers there is a statue of Roosevelt in which it.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Was controversial to fill more than one but

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
. It's not that kind

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000
of thing. Maybe someday there will be but

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:31.000
.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:35.000
It's the generations of people who lived and died I don't I don't think

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:41.000
it's the people that knew their pain

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000
debility that was ignored.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Home.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
That got the word out.

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
To change things.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Even this library used to be located in a building with steps when it

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:03.000
Was recorded in the library as well as when it was

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:08.000
downtown it was it had steps of the at home you know it's just one

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000
of those things even right thinking people make mistakes. New Times editorial page opposed

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:18.000
they opposed the size of the transportation Jesse Helms got to say even

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
this New York paper opposed the N.E.A. home

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000
We've come a long way.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.000
But right now there is an injunction in the Labor Standards Act for shelter to work for

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.000
people with disabilities that they can be paid less than minimum wage. There's an essential

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:42.000
in the Philippines and exactly home care workers who take care of them. They should be paid

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:48.000
less than minimum wage because of preference in the law of their own building for blind people to be

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.000
news dealers as if that's a great show or as if

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
. There is upward mobility and that there's all kinds of

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:00.000
.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Members of the old. When I was in junior high school

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000
and want to learn.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Room one eleven was where developmentally disabled kids and physically disabled kids

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:17.000
. Intellectually capable physically disabled kids were taught

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.000
in room one eleven or long with developmentally disabled kids

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.000
and the teachers used to joke and you know well

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000
if you want to get sent to well it's not that long

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000
. It's filling up and the world has changed a lot since

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:41.000
and I think it's because of the exposure. But because

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.000
so many problems that still exist and you'd think that exposed would have zero

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:49.000
unemployment still sixty five percent amongst disabled adults.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Two kinds of disabled adults is the kind that worked and one of the disabled now get

01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:01.000
benefits and then there's the kind of want to work despite that is a vote.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:06.000
They get lumped together when we say sixty five percent.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.000
But. The employment needle has not moved. Even though we have a

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
huge problem.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
People are going to live longer than ever before they're going to be disabled and they're going to need

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:24.000
places to live and places to work and ways to get.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Their computers and the Internet. One even a dream when I thought it was worth it

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000
.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:32.000
But.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:37.000
People would say to me Don't you realize that and thirty years no one's going to be riding the subway

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.000
. People will be telecommuting. The idea of travelling to work will

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:44.000
be.

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Old only doing it the wrong.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I did worry that by the way I did what they said the thing that my children would

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:58.000
say you know those things that look like elevators in the subway. People tell me you did not even use

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:03.000
that why did we do. Again Larry

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:08.000
I didn't say I couldn't hear but more ridership

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:13.000
now than it was when we started this one hundred thousand over

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:18.000
one hundred twenty thousand people a month ride the bus in which one hundred one thousand trips a

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.000
month in addition to that. Even though you're only twenty thousand and

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:28.000
think I'm going to you know that he's in the subway because it's far more than people in which

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:33.000
home. But in addition to that excessive like the paratransit

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.000
program which cuts said he can get everybody arrives at nine billion a year

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.000
. Last year was six hundred million dollars to give you some sense of the

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000
scale of that that's as much as running the Metro North. So we're talking about a

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.000
huge amount of money and that is because

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:58.000
the M.T.A. cheated on station access they wanted to keep as many stations and accessible as

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:03.000
possible. So in to borrow travel. Is almost impossible if you're

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.000
physically. Because none of the station access so you call

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.000
excessive by excessive ride has no ability to deny rights

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:17.000
. The only way they can. They can have a

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:21.000
building to pass to be constraint they have to keep meeting demand

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
the reason we wrote the law that way is to make them make stations accessible but it took a whole

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:31.000
generation of transit management to realize. And. They do real

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:37.000
mother claim. It's late and you have a paratransit dependent population

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:42.000
and an elderly community that will not quit. They want to travel they want to go to shows

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:47.000
they want to shop and they are going to college has a right to do it now that it

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:52.000
isn't what the transportation is. So there's huge

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:56.000
demand it's not going away the only solution is getting everybody over that

01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:01.000
system. And onto another. So what's the other

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:05.000
. Well it's accessible mass transit and taxis

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
is our biggest victory of late

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
bloomer for eleven years eleven months of his

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:20.000
twelve year term. Post acceptable to us.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:26.000
For the seventeen years.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Five years of war and twelve years with them we fought for this is a bill that says

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
and some years ago.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Disability rights advocates a Berkeley group who opened the New York office represented

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.000
us home we worked with wonderful lawyers

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.000
civil and skin to leap in over two years now and and home of the

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.000
home. And in the.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Eleventh month. Of the twelfth year. November

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:03.000
decided that he disliked the owners more than us

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:09.000
and there was a thing in Crain's New business that said that he actually said he's going to

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.000
cripple an industry to a

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:18.000
. Captain the guy you know when he's no one in there. That's

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:23.000
happening by the way over. But three years

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.000
ago. Overblown Bo's objection we got to Andrew Cuomo who created the

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.000
green taxis the street help to make twenty percent of the Green he's

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:37.000
accessible and runs the sale of new beginnings two

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:42.000
thousand new taxes all of which would have to be will checked

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
.

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Hong.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.000
So you know the millions would sell for a million. That would raise two billion dollars

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:59.000
The city would get that money and take money from that to pay for the green

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:04.000
taxi accessibility features home the city has only

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:09.000
sold four hundred of those because

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Goober has made the value of medallions drop like a rock.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.000
So these three million thirteen thousand taxis the

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:24.000
guy hands were selling for a million at auction. I mean thirteen billion dollars worth of

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
assets.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Are owned by a taxi was. Certainly not driver's horns

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:36.000
yet. They dropped about

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
twenty five percent.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Because we were so those hundred fifty thousand so the city and is afraid of

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.000
because of the size of the community of yellowjackets is probably shrinking because of

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:51.000
certainly the black car business is shrinking because of over

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000
And they don't want to set the bar low on the guy and he's

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:03.000
so delayed but they have to have because in the eleventh month of the

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:08.000
twelfth year we need to do a little bit more litigation. Fifty percent of the excess

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:13.000
of all the twenty twenty. This will change the meaning of the word taxing

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.000
. To excess update when that happens

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:22.000
. Despite M.P.'s reluctance Lupton's to jump in with both feet

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.000
and despite N.T.A. failure to use transit as a

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:30.000
feeder to mass transit.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:35.000
To reduce travel times on these long in the US when we come back empty

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000
they would take it to the number one traded Riverdale of the festival and you could take it to the world

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000
where you work and it would be a five dollar paratransit trip. Instead they make an

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:51.000
average ride sixty dollars to the taxpayers and they're over

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:56.000
sixty plus the right it pays them as pets and so

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:01.000
. And so it's on twenty dollars a day. The taxpayer one

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:05.000
used home that's what six hundred million dollars

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:09.000
The regulation which I was on the committee to write.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:14.000
With us the politician implementing near here and the statute which I helped

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.000
write encourages them to use these feeder easily accessible vehicles as feeders

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:23.000
knows what paratransit is feed a service commitment that they know

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.000
home and their costs are astronomical.

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:32.000
But taxis were sensible and readily available with G.P.S.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.000
having real time dispatching and you could watch it continue just like overdoes on your

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
palm.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.000
And yet with avail themselves of this that would be a huge load shift from these giant He

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.000
says the road ahead of the veterans to taxis will be a labor

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.000
displacement Yes those guys will lose their jobs lots of them work but costs will

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:59.000
go way way down the Eagles' approach is privately.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Could sure privately that fuel privately they're operated by a private individuals in a public

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:10.000
place. In addition to that Medicaid in the five boroughs spends two

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:14.000
hundred million Iowa two thousand and ten dollars two hundred million just to get people to the doc

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:19.000
in which two hundred million a year. Privately operated in the

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:23.000
labs. They would switch to the taxes because that would be done

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
and nobody is saying it is there

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:30.000
. That savings some of it could be dedicated to pay for the ability futures at

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.000
least in the first generation or two and he says he's so that owners don't get

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
her.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.000
Hoover does not own cars. Hoover is just a

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:46.000
vehicle matcher they dispatched to people and on their car. Who

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:51.000
want to drive they arrange financing for you. If you want to drive for them but they don't own your

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.000
car they say they're not covered by the law.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Who is being sued for example for not picking up somebody with a guidebook

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Hoover says. Oh that's the Dr

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Robinson was going on with what we should be saying and what I told you

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:16.000
read a meeting last week to say is you can still say you're not covered by the

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:21.000
law. Both I and the Justice Department disagree about. The Justice Department

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:26.000
file filed. What state of interest in the guy

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
below takes I thought about saying they are covered.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:33.000
So this is not a done deal by any means whether they're covered or not but what

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:38.000
we should be saying is over. We don't care

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:42.000
what the law is. We don't discriminate. We take gay

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.000
people. Where they want to go and we take black people where they want to go

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:53.000
and we take people with guide dogs where they want to go because we do the right thing

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:58.000
and if you want to drive with us still here with us or for us depending on

01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.000
your perspective.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Who would say with I would say for home

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.000
. If you want to know these a little. The tenets

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.000
of. Working with us that you're going to go away and that would be a

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.000
public position and then you would have no qualms with the you know if you

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:24.000
can force that policy. Yeah right you can read you're a good writer once you say one thing

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000
.

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:32.000
Can you imagine if they said we weren't Jews or blacks or gays.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000
And it's not me it's the brother that wanted blacks over when

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:43.000
they wouldn't even begin to say. But that you say that that is a good moment when

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000
he was mayor said amazing that accessible days he said that the

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000
ride won't be as good and it says that he is.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.000
Religious and but what is

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:01.000
now factory built accessible the sedan

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:05.000
car called the only one that's made by in general that makes the home is for the

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:10.000
military and he is buying them so you can see them in New York with the excess

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:15.000
right paint hung on me and he is buying them in the road worthy

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:20.000
because they you know in New York he really get beat up when you operate twenty four hours

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000
. Hong ten of the empty one.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000
But.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.000
When. Bloomberg was mayor he invented this concept of the taxi of

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.000
tomorrow and having design competition. They awarded the contract in this time from an

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:43.000
inaccessible taxi then made a deal with us which was requires

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:48.000
new taxis to be built shipped sent to a factory to be

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.000
retrofitted cut into the car and make them accessible in a very design

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.000
in my opinion and. They never want to

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:02.000
take this for the taxi of tomorrow. If they knew that the excess but

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.000
it was a last minute decision by the may.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.000
So we're stuck with this

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:11.000
. We're trying to get a bill through city council now to change it

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:18.000
and require site entry vehicles instead of treat

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:23.000
the nissen only allows one other passenger Besides you when it's configured like

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:28.000
inaccessible car has to be up front on the other side of the tension with the driver

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:33.000
. It's just going to take that way if you have two children you can't

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:38.000
even take them again. Hum the empty one is plenty of room

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:43.000
and other designs would be better. So home.

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:51.000
That's the journey there is really a long while there

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:55.000
is yet another hands of other stories in there. But but

01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:00.000
. You know we sued new CD

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000
programs. And. We go into the judge's chambers before the first

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:09.000
hearing in which we want to blow hundreds of millions of dollars for the government

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:14.000
and our judges federal district court judge

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000
. So have you driven in this city

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.000
there are so many clowns don't you think these puddles did you think it was a

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:28.000
record. You know there's no

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:33.000
legal mandate. Something else. Is a

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:38.000
legal mandate to refer to curbs that are just not doing it. That's not what I

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:39.000
asked you.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Well no.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:47.000
We don't think so. We think that they should do what they have to do legally and then do

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:51.000
. What we do with it.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:58.000
You know this just goes on and you get these you know movies and

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:03.000
things that portrayed as Bill again you know we just had a very rare name

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.000
windows there to perform with less than what I

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.000
actually told it was two winners would be Julianne Moore

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:18.000
with Alzheimer's and even then yeah you know Cumberbatch had

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:24.000
Asperger's the guy in the.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.000
One of the breaking that cycle. Yeah I guess he was a NASCAR is kind of a guy

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:34.000
but not acute enough to win an Oscar for this verdict. But you know I was a

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:39.000
train man you know my left foot and keep winning things and I'm

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:43.000
hardly the first person to point it out but I know it's true.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:47.000
But disability interesting to people I think when they're not afraid of it.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000
Obviously mental health issues are out there and people are still scared and

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:56.000
you know it's a mess.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000
What's what's next for you in your

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.000
home.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:13.000
Well Grandpa OK I got remarried and

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:18.000
I don't know what was three girls and I have three boys and.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:25.000
They're all getting married having children so I have five and I have grandchildren now

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:30.000
all three of them and they just keep coming. So

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000
I would like to grow old with them and

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:36.000
.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Write all this down one day. It's really been an amazing

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.000
odyssey all the people I've met in my life

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:46.000
.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Disability and their stories and I would like to tell it and I would like to

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.000
tell the stories of the horrors I work with who are just lost and in

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:02.000
some I still talk to and see so many that it is gone I don't know what happened and then

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:06.000
voted with his buddies and lawyers home and government officials who started neck

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:11.000
out who oppose their bosses who said go away

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:16.000
when it was so easy not to. Those stories.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:19.000
You know they deserve to be told. And.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.000
You know guys like my example are donated forty eight home

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:30.000
. Didn't see all the things we've seen home. Somebody should write it

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000
down for them and I will do that. Home

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.000
.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:40.000
You know I have a thousand of these stories like you can tell I

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:45.000
really have to be judicious to figure out some format to get it

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:48.000
told and was thinking

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I think that it deserves it home

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000
.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:02.000
You know I see people I felt and where they'd gotten buzzes with the

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:07.000
lift operating and I feel good about it I guess. Today I was

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
just I was on my way into the city for this.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:16.000
I work in Queens so I was coming in and my station

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:21.000
to go and say you don't like them either you have has another and I want to go

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.000
down you know they don't know the chair. I watched him get over the gap which is a huge

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:31.000
problem. How many stations with his chin to get on the train and I actually

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:36.000
do feel good. I do I have to admit when the lifts her you know her used and

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:40.000
I feel as I do feel good I feel like some personal.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Involvement home.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:48.000
You know my friends and rose think I had something to do with everything and of course I did

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:54.000
but the things that I did have something to do with I feel good about

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:59.000
things that are nothing to do with I feel good because I feel like just making these arguments paves

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:04.000
the way for other people to be successful that we once had a

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:07.000
deaf mother a mother of a deaf child.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:12.000
From the Lower East Side as panic woman whose kid was going to be mainstreamed into the

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:17.000
public school system and then been treated at public expense

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.000
and private school until then. And they asked to help protect her

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.000
child from public school. She's thirteen years old. They'll be picked on

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:30.000
the Hill the whatever and we can help her with it and like

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:36.000
We said we hope that when he was in school get what was appropriate

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:42.000
and. It's impossible to explain to mums that interlude grist for

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:45.000
somebody's civil rights.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.000
But that's what that was and I feel I still feel badly about icon's age

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
thirty something years ago.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:01.000
We had a guy that we actually had a case against these drive through convenience

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:06.000
stores that the local Dairy Barn on Long Island years ago I don't want it to have a few of them

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:10.000
still when you pull into like up to a sliding door and you can order

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.000
from new car groceries and then

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.000
. When something is up

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:23.000
. Here you know you can walk to it because they want to make sure they

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:28.000
weren't selling drugs. So we had to study

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:33.000
I think you know Michael and time wanted a studio

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:38.000
. For it and I said I really was against

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:43.000
it I said that we don't it's just not the right feel for me

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:48.000
and she said to keep it out of the newspaper which she did. Oh and we

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.000
let her do it but you know the right to drive drunk was not something we want.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:59.000
We've had lots of these little ones that were hard to

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:04.000
figure out and one of the guys I helped who's still a friend able

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:09.000
to go forward and spoke to was you don't want to be a parole officer who had a history

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.000
of seizure disorder years before.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000
But he had to carry a gun and then with licenses and it was in that six weeks that I worked for the

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.000
governor they got it fixed and he would talk

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:26.000
. He went through his whole career as a prose of course no problems with

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:31.000
the disability and retired and keep things he owes it to me and

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.000
says things like that. So when that happens which is rare I should say

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:41.000
and you know I really feel for the most part you think about and the next frustration and it is a

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:44.000
mess to clean up and it's going to go problem solved.

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:50.000
But for me you know I'm going to be sixty four next month.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:57.000
I'm on the board of the American Association of People With Disabilities which on the founder of twenty years ago

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:03.000
and stay I know you'll be interested in what I do

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:08.000
but I would like to withdraw a little bit from the day to day I'm not even

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
close to doing that.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:14.000
People talk to me about a tiny you know really close like

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.000
you know Thursday night I was stuck on the train in the snowstorm and

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.000
I don't like that at all

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:32.000
and. I have a feminine porch

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:36.000
onto the ark. So this is what we were doing in India

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:41.000
and he retired years ago and I actually said he had a health problem.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:46.000
But I actually said that when he retired but I said to him you can just step back. And

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:51.000
he said you'll know when you're ready. So I think that obviously you can't but

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:56.000
you'll know when you're ready I know now I didn't only met a few years ago but I actually

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:01.000
you know I mean that now I see it. Coming I I feel like a grandpa

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:06.000
. When I was forty I

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:11.000
was you know newly divorced mother forty one and I still thought the whole world

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:17.000
How my got a job by the Clinton administration to contain it because it would

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:22.000
have moved to Washington and I.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Thought so what. The whole world's economy there is not anymore I mean there's a lot

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:32.000
about you know the bulk of it's over and I'm happy with what's

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
happened.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:39.000
Love all the folks I met along the way. The difficult ones to

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.000
elect more you know memory it's easy to take

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:50.000
away all the animosity and pain the the people I don't want to give the

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:55.000
people who won't see what we see. Refuse to see less and

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:59.000
less that is to let. The taxi industry now listens to us

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:04.000
. They're so afraid of who are there working with us now they have a mandate.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:11.000
There are friends home. It's an unusual way to make a friend but it's a

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:16.000
friend so the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:21.000
So you know we made a lot of friends along the way too and we call on them now when we need

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:26.000
them to help us. HONE National Domestic Workers

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.000
Alliance.

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Has raised the minimum wage for home care workers who are trying to

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:39.000
work so that people don't lose home care hours to help them get a

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:44.000
raise we're hoping they help us get over the hump on

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:49.000
losing all that was the last thing we wanted to pay to put people and institutions

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
who want to pay for them and community living.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
So there's always going to be issues like.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.000
So.

02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Right now it's not how

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:02.000
long.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:09.000
I don't believe it. I think they'll always be. Disability

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:14.000
related problems that require.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:19.000
More than compassion that require understanding and insight into the person but also

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000
some of the people of the future who are working.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Related problems. After all you're doing this like take a principled

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:34.000
stand. And. They. Were

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:39.000
instead to think about men's frustration because I'm sure there were

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
moments of you know frustration.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:45.000
Sure what they all yeah I'm not saying

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:50.000
. You know my son asked my grandfather when he was eighty eighty

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:55.000
five grandpa wasn't like to be eighty five and

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:59.000
thought about it.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:00.000
You know when you're eighty five

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:05.000
. They stopped started it was a big you know we

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:10.000
had and then he won. When you're eighty five and you bend down to dye his shoes you

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:14.000
think of other things to do while you're down there.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:21.000
You know he couldn't address all of that big life. What's the most

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:26.000
what's the biggest change since you're alive. He asked me once like. That

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000
is pretty big. I don't

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:34.000
. Have a big picture here.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:37.000
I really need to remove myself a little.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Today's frustration is a solved problem tomorrow

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.000
and I promised of the frustration today's place immediately.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Today's happy client is. Usurped by

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:56.000
tomorrow's unhappy client and. Things

02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:01.000
change. One of the lawyers I was talking about said Wilensky that

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:06.000
case with us actually represented leprous he's older than I am so happy

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:10.000
represented letters in Hawaii when they were trying to close the only leper colony

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:16.000
in the US home. He's got a much bigger retrospective

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:21.000
than I do you know I would say Sid was represented a lot of

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:26.000
letters. But this is you know these things are huge that we

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:31.000
dealt with but I know there's huge ones to be done. We just don't even know what

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:35.000
they are you know and it'll happen.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.000
Is there any stop.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:45.000
It's only that this is a great interview as many people as you can interview

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.000
. Some people's experiences are so anecdotal and so unique

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:55.000
to themselves that they seem almost irrelevant. But when you put them all

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:59.000
together they make a big picture. So no matter how quirky and weird

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:05.000
story sounds and unique to that individual when you listen

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:08.000
to one hundred you get it.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Yet.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.000
And when you listen and one you know it's easily dismissable

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:19.000
people are too quick to write about people with disabilities because of their perception and also people

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:24.000
know somebody who's disabled and this is the exception. Their brother their sister the lover the

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:28.000
mother that was the one they know it was that guy was disapproved to eat and go.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:32.000
But then again I just can't do it it's just not true. Just just on when you know that

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:38.000
home. But it takes some perspective to get it and he get

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:43.000
it by talking to people. So like I said even when you're interviewing a guy

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:47.000
that's only talking about himself. His unique experience that's

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:52.000
personal to him when you put them all together and makes this fabric of people with

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:57.000
disabilities who are woven incredibly into the community.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Blatche Jews Italians up down down down he said was that

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.000
there's no. Denominator that's not common

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:11.000
. Because gay is able people you know

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:16.000
it's just everywhere. Because of that and because we want people to be

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:21.000
assimilated. They don't stand up and say I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore they

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.000
only do when there's a problem. My brother's diabetic Isn't think of

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:30.000
themselves disabled till he tries to buy insurance you know over seventy banks and through

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000
his disability.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:37.000
There will be a lot I say you know but but that's the way it is

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000
.

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:43.000
For taking part in this I feel terrible that I told you

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:44.000
so long.
