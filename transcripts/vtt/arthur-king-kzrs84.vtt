00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
(Dianne: So tell me what makes you different from other individuals Author

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
(Author: When I went to high school 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Finding to... someone...would let...that

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 ?Inaudible?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
To come and talk. Help me with the walk 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
which makes it diff - me different  - from everyone else. So you needed 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Assistance? No. Do you consider your life

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Difficult? Sometimes it's difficult

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and sometimes not. What makes life difficult for you?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 I can't ? chew? everything and people

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that are not disabled ?with gym?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Can you tell me if there is anyone that is the most important person in your

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
life? Who is the most important person in your life?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
My mother.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
What is the most important lesson you've learned from your mom?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That we keep on trying. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
They think they can't do 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
something and maybe they'll be able to do it.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I have a favorite quote and that 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
quote is "The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
be." Tell me what person you decided to be, Arthur.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
A 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
librarian. You want to be a librarian? Yeah. I work for a library.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 Do you want to work for a public library? Which one? I work for the Huguenot library

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
New York Public Library. That's who's doing this project.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Do you want to become a librarian? I am. I work at the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
?Macomb's Bridge Library? Oh, that is incredible. Very good.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Can you finish this sentence for me? I draw my strength from...

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
What makes you strong?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
What... what are some of the things when you wake up in the morning do you

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
feel. Strong? Do you feel sad? Do you feel like

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 have courage? I feel like I have courage. And what makes you feel

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
like you have courage? What are some of the things that make me feel like I feel so courageous

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
today. Is it anything in particular that makes you feel that way?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Just my mother

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and my ?family? trying to get me to come to school

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
to get my education.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Is there something you would like people to know about individuals

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
like yourself, Arthur, that battle with a disability every day?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
It's not fun

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
to deal with it and make me take medication and stuff.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Well, I want to thank you so much for this interview.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
common. Thank you so much. We'll be -- You're welcome.Thank you very much.
