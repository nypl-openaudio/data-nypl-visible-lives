00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This is Alex Kelly and I am sitting here with Noeliz Luisa Lee

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Luisa Lee and it is January twenty-first two thousand

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
fifteen. We're sitting here at City College at the accessibility center and

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I am interviewing Noeliz for Andrew's High School Braile and

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Talking Book Library's project 'Invisible Lives Oral Histories of the Disability

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Experience' through the New York Public Library. I'm just going to start out

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Noeliz and ask you a little bit about where you came from. You can tell me a little bit about your background. OK,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Ok, well I come from the Bronx, New York.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That's where I was born and raised, um, I like to think that I come from two different

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
places. My ethnicity is Chinese and Dominican, so I'm both Asian and

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Hispanic. And my father is Chinese and my mother is Dominican so I like to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
think that I was imported and that I was born here.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Well right now I'm twenty-two. And I'm going to school and I'm studying

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
environmental engineering at the City College of New York. And I

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
just got approved to graduate so I'm super excited about that, I'm gonna to finish, thankfully.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And, you know, I came to this project because I'm

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a student registered here at the disability center and at first it was hard for

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
me to register myself here because most students don't really know

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
about other students disabilities. They usually try to keep it, you know, not as well

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
known or they tell their closest friends. But once I registered myself here

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I found a whole new community of students that are just like me and they made

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
me feel welcomed and my grades drastically improved once I started

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
coming here, registered with the center, and really, like, made a

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
community and made my home here. I'm currently the secretary for the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
disability club that we have here at City College. And I've been involved in a lot of

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
disability awareness projects. And, in my view, what

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
the accessibility center tries to do is, not only educate the public about different

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
types of disabilities but also aid students that have these disabilities and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
communicate with these students as well as the professors or try to communicate

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
through their peers.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Great.  Seems like a really amazing place. You know I can tell as soon as I walked through the door.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Tell me what- I want to go back a little bit.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Tell me a little bit about growing up in the Bronx, and kind of early childhood memories

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 Well, growing up in the Bronx is tough.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It really, you know, makes you a New Yorker when you grow up in the Bronx.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
My parents immigrated here. So they went through the immigrant

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
experience. My mom worked in a factory job and my dad used to work in

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Philadelphia also on a factory job, and what ended up happening is that my

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
father, um, ended up actually going back to college with my older sister

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So they ended up graduating together I believe in 2001. So that really inspired

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
me, you know to keep on going and my mom also ended up going back to college and my

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
dad finished his two degrees by the time I think he was forty and he

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
had three kids already. So I think that was a big source of inspiration especially you know

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
coming from the Bronx and the type of economical

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
social situation that you're in.  For them to persevere, come from another country, and learn the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
language and, you know, end up getting their degrees that was something really

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
motivational for me and it keeps me going 'til today,  'til I see my

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
dad at work wake up every morning and go to work, and just realize

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that he provided for my family, as well as my mom. She also

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
provided and worked a factory job to just try to maintain the household.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I think that's a big motivational thing for me and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I think that's something that the Bronx really does them for . These are working class people

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that really built up for themselves, a community that's really strong and

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
they try to send their kids to college and they try to really make sure that their kids get

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
a proper education and I think that's what my parents did and they did a good job. I'm graduating, so

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I'm really excited.[Congratulations.] Thank you. [So this is your last semester?]

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I got approved to graduate the next Fall.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
[OK.] And then I walk the next spring. So right now I'm working on

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
a project - a geology project, which is, um, to actually go to a

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Third World country and try to create a engineering

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
system which the local people can run which actually filters out

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
the unclean, unpotable water and makes it clean water so that way they can eat,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
they can bathe, and they can run it themselves and it'll be something

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that is economically sound for them to run as well as a very viable

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
plan for a Third World country to have because you know, as we know, some of these countries

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
water is a precious resource and, um, these people get sick from

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
drinking unpotable water, and that's the type of work that I want to

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
do, that's a type of work that I wanna hopefully accomplish with a

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
non-profit in the future, if I get to work with one. [That sounds amazing.]

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
OK you're kind of making me want to do it.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Thanks. The inspiration came from my parents, since they came

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
from the Dominican Republic. And right now they have a

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
sort of great economical resources in terms of speaking as a Third World country, they are not considered to

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
be one. But I remember that they told me that when they were younger,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
They had to go to a stream to wash their clothes and get water in.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
so that way they can go to their houses and they didn't have the amenities that we do have

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
now. And so seeing how they grow up and hearing stories about them

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and what they needed to do to just get clean water sort of inspired me to

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
get into a field where I can make a difference in someone's life.  Even though I'm not there

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
physically, I'm still there trying to start a project to

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
hopefully touch someone else's life, maybe someone I've never even met, and try to get them

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
a basic resource which is water.  Water, you know, is what we need to

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
keep ourselves healthy and I think that making a viable

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
resource for them to reach that water is something that we as a country

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
in the United States, we need to do for other countries. Help them to develop a system

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.000
where they can get their people - first it's water then we can go in with something like

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
education. But it all starts with a basic resource and then building upon it.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Mm

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
It's amazing.  And so your parents seem like incredible people, I just wanna

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
kind of go back a little bit.  What types of stories that they share with you about work?  What

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
types of, kind of words of wisdom did they pass on to you growing up?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And, did you have siblings?  Oh, yes I do.  I have two siblings.  I have an older

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
sister and I have a younger sister. And I remember like one story that my

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
dad told me. And it was when we were building my backyard

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
actually.  We recently bought a house and this was when I was about twelve or thirteen

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and it was a big deal for us and my backyard was just full of dirt

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and mud and grass and, um, he told me, you know, we're going to build

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
paradise. I really didn't understand what that meant I was just like, dad, you're just gonna

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
make a garden in the backyard. I didn't understand that. So then me and him we started

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
doing the backyard work together and he taught me how to, you

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
know, pick up the weeds and clean the backyard and we eventually made

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the backyard out of tiles. He taught me how to put in the tiles and it was such

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
hard work to do it with him, and it was a family project. But in the end of the

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
project I actually understood what he was talking about. He meant we're going to build paradise

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
in the United States.  The backyard was going to be my parents', like, safe haven where they

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
can garden and things like that and my mom ended up growing

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
sunflower plants, like, on the back wall and my dad ended up

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
making like his own little corner with his chair where he can listen to his like sixties

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
music which, you know, he showed me pictures of him in an afro

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
so that was funny enough.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But I understood the, the whole process you know.  I work hard with them to build

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
something that the whole family can enjoy and each little

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
piece, like my mom's flower garden and my dad's, my dad planted an apple tree and a pear

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
tree and they just started giving fruit, you know, within a couple of

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
years.  That was a big deal for us and it meant, you know

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
we've reached a point in our lives that we can now enjoy

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
the fruits of our labor, it's - we worked hard to get there but now that we got there

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
let's work even harder to make sure that we can create a place that we can all share

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and I think that was what really clicked with me with the sense of community and

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000
we ended up creating a community garden and people come from, you know, next door because

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
the gardens have passageways through all the houses and everyone sort of created their own little

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
niche and we visit each other all the time and cook outside and I think it's even

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
cute when I'm - like, little squirrels and little animals come to my garden and steal things.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So I, I think that even the sense of community, even having like a squirrel come in to take

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
an apple from a tree. It's something very small but you know it's something

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
very enriching I think for me to grow up, enriching to

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
know that hard work pays off. And when it does pay off

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
you have to get back to everyone else.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I think that's the biggest lesson.  That's great.  That's amazing. So great that you

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
have that space too that you share with your family that you all work together to

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
build. So tell me a little bit about your decision to go to

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
City College and what that was like, and, you know, a little bit about your

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
history and education kind of growing up in the school system.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Well I went to CEX eleven. That's a public school in the Bronx.  It was very

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
close to my house and, um, I just remember going to school every day my

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.000
mom would dress me up in pig-tails and I would hate it and I

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
just grew up a very normal life.  And then I went to a private school

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Sacred Heart Middle School and that's a private institution.  It's a Catholic

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
school.  And I went there because it was also close to my

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
house and by that time, nine-eleven already happened. So my parents wanted me

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
to stay closer to the house, closer to the home, and they made a big sacrifice to send me to a

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
private school. But they know that it was, you know, more in the interest of safety to keep me

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
closer to the house.  And my dad is actually an educator in Washington

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Heights and he's been there for over twenty-something years so for him, our

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
safety was important and getting home was important after nine-eleven. And my

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
high school experience, I went to Mother Cabrini High School.  And I remember distinctly

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
in my junior year that I went to a counselor in an outside of school

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
program and I told that counselor that- about my disability and they

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
said, you know, I don't think that you're going to make it through high school.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And I said, you think I'm NOT gonna make it through high school?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And then I took a course I was really upset and I told my

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
parents. So then I went in the next year and I ended up

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
graduating valedictorian top of my class and I went back to him

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
. And I showed him that I graduated top of my class and I got accepted into

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
N.Y.U. in college and I got accepted into all these great

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000
colleges that have all the programs that I wanted to attend and he just

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
said you know good job and I'm so old so you said to me good job when you figure it

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
out but I had a disability and told me I couldn't do it.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
So when I went back there and you know I showed him what I did and I was like

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
. What I really need to do this. No need to show you anything.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
You're someone that doesn't know what they're talking about. You can sit there you call

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
yourself a counselor for a program the children's you know kids attend after

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
school and you tell someone they can't do something

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
. I really told my parents and they went with me and

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
they spoke to the gentleman and apparently he wasn't very well versed

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
in how to speak to students that have disabilities. He thought that he could just say you know

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
you're not going to make it so I'm going to make it. Why. Because if we're going to have a

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
disability or you know because I come from the Bronx or

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
my you know racially profile to be successful in going to

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
college what are you really telling me I think that was a big motivator in my life I was

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
in something huge in my life where out while other people that exist like him

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
because with my disability my parents didn't really. Single me out. They may need

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
the same as everybody else. I've always lived in a place where I was the same as everybody

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
else. I didn't really talk about a disability unless you know people asked. And when

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I told them that I educated them they understood about it but this was one person

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
that was educated clearly went to college has a degree in counseling

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
and didn't know what to tell me. Besides you never made it to college

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
. That was a big motivator for me and it still is today.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And when I got my college degree I would go back to his office and I want to be like well

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I finally got over it and I think just having

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
that strength and speaking to people and at a young age I was I was speaking to him like if I

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
was an adult like seventeen or sixteen when I met him and he told

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
me you know we're going to make it and I went to him by myself. And I told him

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Listen I am going to make it I'll come back to you because you know I'm tough

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
. I'm suffering from the Bronx.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
You know you can get the bronze up the girl but you can get the girl of the Bronx

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
and I think.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
With my education that's something that really motivated me and even now in

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
college I ran through an experience where I had to tell a professor that he asked me in

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
public. To me my disability. And that was a

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
really embarrassing experience I went to the senator

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And I told them about it. And they were really happy to

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
. Sort of name my experience where my disability if you have people have

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
never met me. And the cells are they counseled

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
me and they brought me back up. And they told me about my rights as a disabled

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
student. And I was able to go to that professor. I

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
was able to tell him you know my rights were violated. He had no idea

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
. And it was a very traumatic experience to go through

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
because I would never have someone call me out in public and tell me

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
you know we should you should tell me what your disability is because

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
if you don't I'm not going to accommodate you.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And that was something that I went through and I came to the center here

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and I talked to a counselor. And they helped me through it and I

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
eventually finished the class easing it and I

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
went back to this professor and I said you never knew I had a disability and I was going to show you days in

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
your class. And once you know I had a disability. You told

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
me to name it in front of everybody else. And I refused to do so

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
. And I told him it was illegal for him to ask me.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And once he knew that I was knowledgeable about exactly what was being asked of me

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
. He immediately stopped. And I

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
gave him a pamphlet on the disability center. And I felt

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
like that's how he. Ended up being educated. And then he

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
explained to me that he came from a different country or people that have disabilities are not

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
considered the same as he was. He apologized to me

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
because he told me I would never be an engineer. He told me that I would change my

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
major and that I should pick something else because no one would want to work with me because of my

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
disability. When he

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
apologized to me. And I took it in and I was

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
. Sort O. grateful. For the fact that he

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
eventually learned from living in the cloud of ignorance where he thinks that

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
people with disabilities shouldn't have the same opportunities as everybody else

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
. And I eventually ended up having a good relationship with this professor

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000
. But it reminds me that people at this. Level. Oh

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
college. I actually believe that students with disabilities can

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
make it. And once I finish classes it's this class and

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
. I went to the to the next couple of classes. I just

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
took what he's told me and they said all this is this is got to change.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
We have to educate people and that's when I became secretary of the club

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
. And I became a lot more active as a student to voice

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
. The fact that students with disabilities are not what people think they are. They look

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
like everyone else if their disability is really apparent and

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
that students with disabilities can do everything that other students can do. And that's

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
when I became more involved in the community here and. Through my life

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
learning and being educated in these were a couple of select

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
people that told me you can't do it you can't make it. You should find

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
something else to do because you will never get there and I'm still here

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
and I'm Brazilian and I am proof that. I can make it and if I

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
can do it everyone else can.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
So it seems like you are teaching people a lot

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
. I just with two gentleman you know who

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Who were obviously coming from a place of sense you

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
know I just I respect so much that you came back to that means that

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
doesn't make this Israelis are my rights and I'm sure that a lot of

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
people listening to this story. Villains. Do you want to

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
talk a little bit about your disability. Yeah like that was like over the years

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
. Well I was diagnosed of having A.D.T.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
And at first you know my parents didn't really believe it because they came from a country

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
where things like that don't exist.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
OK so they didn't believe in it and then my dad

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
he's actually had a teacher. And he is an engineer by profession with a

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
degree and he actually started reading up more about it he was like you know what

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
I think you're right we should look into this and then my mom she

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
also ended up looking into it was my dad. If you

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
mention he went to a doctor and I was diagnosed I.V. and then

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
when they started researching more and then they research with me I was about ten. That's when

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
we started learning more about it and then we start learning that there are a lot of kids that are like me

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
and then we also started learning about people that don't think it's real. So they think it's something that

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
people make up and my response to that

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
. Is that my parents stood with me and they still stand by with me

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
and they believe that everything that I'm doing is correct to educate people why it's easy

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
since there are so many people who believe that it doesn't exist and as a student trying to study with

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
A.D.D. it's really hard it's not that you don't want to study Islam or you're not

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
motivated to study or anything it's just. There's there's

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
something sort of with every age it is to for everybody but for me it's

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
something where I'm reading a paragraph.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And I know that I'm reading it I know that I'm reading it word for word but am I really understanding it.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
So there's a difference between reading it understanding the concept building on the concept

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
and then applying the concept which is something that's really important for a student like me to

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
get. So I eventually grew up with my dad sort of teaching me as long as my

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
mom and they read with me every single day so then they sat down with me like

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
so you read it do you understand it. Did you grab the main point. So now how do you apply

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:30.000
it.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
But I guess that's why I decided to do so much in engineering.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
It really is about reading the constant understanding the concept of applying the

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
concept but how can you make it go further in your studies with math and science

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
. So with my project of course it's a lot of reading involved a lot of

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
engineering projects that I have to look up to build upon them to then apply

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
what I do learn and then making something positive come out of it.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
And I think that's one of the major big influences that I have in

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
education my parents. They sat by with me. They you know

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
sat down with me learning to read and learning to grasp concepts

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
and they're some of the you know biggest motivators for me and

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
sit behind me every single time that I go to take a test or an exam

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
and they even built a desk for me to study in my house and things like

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
that. Even though last night I was taking my classes and my

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
parents because they didn't want me to get home late at night because it was so cold. They would

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
actually drive and wait for me outside of school. So I finished and then they

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000
would pick me up and take me home. You know there's a lot of parents do that at this age

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000
that I'm an adult but they didn't do it for me because they understand that engineering is a very

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
hard discipline. And I like to call it a discipline because it's not something that you study

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
it's something that you have to be very dedicated to and discipline yourself

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
to not only study work the professor selling you but take the concept

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
go further and you have to read a lot.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Just to understand something and use it and apply it. And I

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
think.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
That that's how my parents really eating me with

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
my own learning disability and I think that I

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
think parents that have children that A.T.T. should also help their kids like

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
that they should sit down with their kids and you know explain to so many kids are

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
young so they don't really understand what it is explain to them this is what you have and educate their own

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
kids so they can educate other people correctly.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
For people who say it doesn't exist. Can you share a

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
story or a moment that kind of illustrates that. Yes it does and this is what it feels

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
like.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Well I think one of the moments that I can really paint a picture of

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
is I was studying for class last semester

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
and I don't really do very well in my math classes and I

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
think that's why I like math there's not a lot of reading in it there's just you know apply concepts do.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
But this class was more based on theory. So I had to read a lot more

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
applying the concept and do and one of the problems that I had in this math

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
class was that it didn't matter how many times that I've read the book over

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
. It didn't matter how many times that I would watch problems I knew too

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
it was really hard to understand what was a next step or what

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
is the concept that I'm missing that I need to apply some sort of

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
. Mathematical augmentation to the problem so I can get the

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
desired answer.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:59.000
And I would sit there for hours and engineers you know as

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000
usual they study for days on end to try to aim for final so it was normal

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
for me to study maybe three days on and taking breaks and going back to my room and locking

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
myself in and studying and I eventually started I created a

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.000
whiteboard in my room so I just took transparency paper and taped it up and my parents thought

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
that I was running the wall so I made my own little white board and

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
I went to get markers and I started doing every single problem in the book

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
until I saw a pattern until I saw something that I could understand.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
And this took me a while to do. And every time that I would see a

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
pattern I would write it down every time that I would see something that I didn't understand I would have to

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
go back and recheck and recheck.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
So people are saying that it doesn't exist it does exist I would not

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
spend all these hours studying something.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Now I understand the concept when my friend who doesn't have a disability understood it right away

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
. There's no difference between me and my friend we're the same age we study the same

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
thing. We you know G.P.A. wise were the same the only

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
difference is that. I think a little bit longer to understand a concept and she doesn't

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
. I think a little bit longer to something to really sink in

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
. But that doesn't make me any different from her at all.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
And with when I did my process of learning and taping things to the

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.000
wall and researching. All their math books I said last books from

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
my dad and he went to school you know the dinosaur each basically

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
took his books and his books like Spanish and I started reading it in Spanish.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Anderson a lot more in Spanish than I did in English and my first language is English.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
But you know growing up in a mixed language household I got a hold of both of the

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
languages and their reading material in another language and I understood a

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
lot better. And I thought that was really you know interesting and funny because

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
there's people that wrote the two different languages and studying in the U.S.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
and the only reading textbooks in English and I was like it's a shame that there are not

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
a lot of textbooks in Spanish even now my dad was telling me he's an eighth

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
grade teacher now and he teaches in high school and there's a lot of students that speak

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Spanish and come from a country that they've only been taught Spanish and he works hours

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
on end translating material in mathematics from English or Spanish

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
and he said you know I do it because these kids don't know what they don't know

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
. And we have to teach them. And the only way to do that is to take

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
material translating it. And that's the only way they're going to understand the

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
concept and apply the concept. And he spends hours and hours doing

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
that. And I spent hours and hours reading an English book and I understood the

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
material in Spanish and I didn't know that until I started taking my dad's books and started

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
reading it and.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
I think. That part of education especially in

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
a city that's as diverse as New York is something else all

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
affected me where I would read things in English and didn't really

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
understand them or to listen to reading them in another language.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
So interesting studies that are done and they're you know they should

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
have been. So usually both the moving of your

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
diagnosis. Like maybe there were moments leading up to it

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
like wonder like you know what.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Well I knew there was something wrong with me I was always like a very smart kid. So

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
I would research the internet on the newest style for like I would see something on the news

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
that there was talk about some virus I would research myself and my parents when I

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
was ten and they were very computer savvy so I was and I said I

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
was looking at stuff by myself and I was like I feel different I feel different to everybody else I

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000
don't understand things as fast as the other kids do like when they're the

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
problem where they're answering questions they get it faster and I decided that they were

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
something I didn't click with me. And having parents that came from another country where

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
some of the stuff doesn't even really exist or reporting in these and their

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
country. I started doing research for myself so naturally I went to the library

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
. The public library where a lot of information and I

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:38.000
use a computer there and I was figuring out you know that I feel sort

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
of sluggish or slow or that I didn't understand the concept as fast as

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
everybody else and then I started reading up about it and then there are kids that

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
have blogs or their parents read the blogs sort of talking about it. So once I showed

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
it to my parents my parents they were like No you have you.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Know these are all the other kids have that.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
And then when my dad and my mom started looking up more into it they were like OK so

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
I think we should go to a doctor to see if this is something that

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
she might have. And we ended up you know going at ten

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000
and then a little bit later as I grew up as an adult and then they

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
came to not only understand except. Act

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
on what I have. But also. Be a proactive

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
part of my life.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
And I think that that's what you know if there is their kids or parents are recently finding out that their child has

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
that you research accepting it act on it and be proactive about it

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
But students at the college are really interested in your experience here and

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
what it was like to come to the accessibility Center for the first time and what kind of brought me

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
here and with that back on that teacher in class to be part of it is there anything else that

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
kind of made you feel like OK.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Also because I think they're more accepting curious

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
then you know people that probably have never heard about it in their entire life

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
they were expecting they're more curious.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
They asked me questions like you know can you read this or are you OK with that

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Our own classes where I sit next to a friend of mine and she's been in class with me I think

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
twice and she understands that sometimes I can't read what's on the board or

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
sometimes it looks like I have double vision for me and I see it too. Of

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
one thing written on the board or some letters to me just don't

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
click with me. So she'll sit down with me and she'll write big enough so I can see her notebook

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
or she'll make me a copy of her book and highlight things that she thinks are important for me.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
And I think that's a community that you have a city college that students are willing to do that for their fellow

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
students. They're willing to learn a lot more and they're more accepting and curious

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
if anything and they're willing to help you and say you know can you read this

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
so you understand this do you want to go over this problem and I think that one of my

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
friends Her name is Catherine and she helped me and one of my math classes and we both ended up

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
getting A's on it and I told her I'm like I think you're the reason I got an A because he really

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
helped me and she you know we sat down together and studied together like no tomorrow

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
and I think that's a type of community that we have among our peers at City College

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
as what sort of inspired me to go to the accessibility center it wasn't

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
only the comment from that teacher I think it was more of I kept meeting students

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
that were more more like me. And you would never know they hate you because they look like everybody

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
else. Until he told you. And when I met them

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
and we started talking about the same experiences like the experience of not understanding

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
hours and hours of reading something just to understand one concept like

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
this is really this is you know friends that I've been to see my entire

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
life and I've always had normal friends so I felt more at home with them

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
and they were very welcoming when I first came here and I just come in here like a

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
regular day and I just you know chill or talk to everybody about

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
classes or get help in some class and I'm having trouble with and I

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
think that's a community that they try to make it possible and I think they make you feel safe.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
What is it like connecting with other students who are diamonds. Do

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
you have interesting conversations or points of connection is this like one of the first

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
cases for people to do that

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
. Yeah well I met one of my friends Her name is Holmes and she also

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
has a team and when we sat down to talk to each other we

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
were talking about you know. What did we go through having a needy and one of the

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000
biggest things was you know people don't believe it exists.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
So I was like one of the major points people who believe this is this they don't know what we're feeling until you

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
really have to have a do you know what it's like and I was like one of our biggest

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
sort of conversations and when I sat down with her and

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
she told me about her experience of she's reading.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
And it takes a lot for her to read and I am reading and it takes a lot for me to read and to

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
understand and she was telling me you know the trouble that she has taking

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
exams as well because she feels a pressure like all the other students are finishing the exam

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
and she's not finishing on time and that happens to me and you know I was telling

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
her like as an engineering student some other problem solving takes so long pages of it is

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
they don't want to answer. But that sometimes takes me longer to figure out

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
. What is the next step in the problem. And what I'm allowed

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
to do as a student that's registered here is take my

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
exam here in the center and take it in a quiet place

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
and they give me extra time to sort of collect my thoughts and figure

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
it out and I feel like that's been a bigger factor for students

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
here that they get the chance to sit down and think about the excess of what

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
they're supposed to be doing and I think that when I've met her

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
and she sort of told me about the center and told me about the

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
experiences students have here and about the exam experience is terrifying

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
because I mean that's that's what college is based on exams and getting good grades and things

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
like that which she told me about that I was like oh my god like where was this

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
my entire life because I've been taking exams with normal students and I

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
haven't been able to finish just because I haven't been able to read

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
correctly understand the concept and I've been fortunate that I found a lot of teachers to actually

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
take time. Out of their regularly scheduled day and they will sit down with

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
me and tell me you know this is what I want you to do or this is why I can better help

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
you. And I thought it was not a very proactive in trying to learn about students like

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
me how to better teach them instantly.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
So it's a really exciting time to be here. You are graduating next

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
file and you're thinking about this project

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Well right now the location is chosen as Bangladesh. OK so I'm really excited

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
about that and it was not another friend of mine and when

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
I spoke to her she said she read about it in the semester and I talked to her and she talked to

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
me about her project and I ended up applying for just to get

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
research at the school and I ended up meeting someone that's in

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
charge of her project and of course this person didn't know that we were friends until I mentioned oh my

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
God I'm friends with her and they were like so you can take over her project when she graduates

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
. You can be a continuation of her project. Every project was based on water

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
resources and she may need an entire research project about water resources in

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Bangladesh and I wanted my project to be a continuation of her since she is

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
my friend and I would love her country and I love her culture so

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
much different from mine and she taught me so much about her country in

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Bangladesh and now you know the struggle that people go through there on a regular

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000
basis and I will say I think it'll be interesting to bring my fusion

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
of being Hispanic and Asian and bringing her fusion and

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
I'm like well you know might as well be. You know a citizen of your country

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
and I think. That when we develop that community of I'm from here you're from

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
there. Well let's meet somewhere in the middle. That's when I started thinking about

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:00.000
what is it that she needs for me to do. Because if you know it was part of her

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
plan to develop this water system and then now my plan is

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
how can I make it work. And I think if I can get more like minded people think how

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
can I make it work.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
You know whether it be an engineering project or anything like that I think it's a more productive use of

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
time. So I saw her project and said OK so you're

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
graduating How can I make your project and make it real. Make it tangible make

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
it something that. These people can run for themselves. And

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
don't lead don't need to rely on anyone These are people that live in small village communities that can have a

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
system or they can clean their own water and filter their own water and hot water

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
to cook to clean to do basic necessities. And you

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
sort of make these people. The same as other people that are fortunate enough to have clean water

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.000
.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
And I think the can do attitude that she has and then I have sort of

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
melded together and we're like let's make this a melting pot. Let's go. But you know

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Tino's and put the faucet together let's put the whole of the U.S. but everything together in the

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
pot and make one big dinner and I think that's one of the most

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
positive things that I found about my friends here City College to come from everywhere around the

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
world get to learn about so many different communities in so many different cultures

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
and I think that was a big motivator for me in this project.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
And so I'm just thinking with a major project to grow water it's like something that

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
everybody regardless of your background or income from

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
it all comes down to this like basic necessity

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
. So after you

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
graduate What are your hopes for the future. What are your thoughts. You know

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
where you're going to next.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Well after I graduate and I finished the internship program that I'm with

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
I was offered a graduate program position in

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000
engineering. Hopefully I get to do that but I was also thinking

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
about either going to law school. Or business school

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000
so you know we had a couple friends are going together or something for the G.R. he sent hopefully we'll get

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
some we get some more of that.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
But I think that home. Life. My biggest goal is to help people

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
. So you know it's not necessary to be a doctor.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
I think another way to help people is that what I'm doing and hopefully I want to work

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
with the U.N.. And with the

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
. U.N. portion that works with communicating to

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
countries and getting them aid and was a project like mine I want to get

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
to an engineer position. Where I can work with the World Bank and I know

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
that they fund projects that help countries that

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
are in dire need of you know water resources and working as an

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000
engineer with them. I can hopefully help. Pass you know

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
legislation or funding for these countries that really need

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:16.000
these types of engineering systems. So their population can get basic

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.000
needs of just water. And like you said water is something over a unifying

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
motif. And I want to get to a position where I can help these

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
people. Maybe I'm not going to be right there next to them are traveling to that country

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:35.000
but you know from my country I can sort of lend a helping hand to their

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
country. And I think that's a lot more unifying and a lot more

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
humanitarian.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
It's great. It's very exciting for him

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
. Is there anything you want to talk about right now in this thing you

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
know I. Think. We haven't been able to talk about. It's important for other people to know

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
about you in your life. I mean listen to this years

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
I think that. I think the biggest message I want to get out here is not

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
the disability part. It's the biggest message is

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
If you're here and you're doing something

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
. And you're doing something that

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
. You know is life changing for you try to change someone else's

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
life not your own.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
I think that's like a big message because what I'm trying to do is not only because

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
you know I want to have a job like everybody. Oh I don't know

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
because you know I want to have a job a house you know a dog named Sparky in

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
the future I don't know but what I'm what I'm trying to do is.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
I like to use the word humanitarian a lot. I'm trying to look at the bigger picture. I'm not you know one

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
person of course you know I want the job with the solvent to

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.000
graduate you know. And. But the bigger picture

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000
here is with this oral history is to communicate that.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
We should be doing more not just resting on laurels not just saying well

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
you know the Red Cross can do this and do that or whatever you know I'm not going to

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
be you know Mrs save the world and be so a woman in charge at home

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
everyone else but if you're doing something even though it's a little like opening the door.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
That's something that's changed someone else's life I like to think that we all live in our own little bubbles

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
of course even when we're on the train New Yorkers are nasty to each other they ignore each other

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
they just go on you know through the train through life and don't really look at the

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
person sitting next to them or standing next to you know how is this person's day

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
even when you bump into someone you'll get the response. Watch out. I move

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
over and I think if you take a minute of your day to realize that you know we all

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
live in different spaces and we all live in our own little bubble spoke when our bubbles interact with each other

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
with a simple touch we do impact each other. So you know I live in my

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
own little mobile right now in New York in the Bronx or whatever but what an adventure really hoping to do is

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
that when I graduate I get to be part of these projects that touch other people's

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
life bubbles. In other countries who have never met but I am doing

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
something to help them and that's a way of touching someone else. So I think the

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
simple message of just touching someone else touching their lives and

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
you don't even have to know who they are but working to change something to

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
make someone else's life better I think is a much better use of my time and I to use the

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
word proactive a lot so I try to stay proactive and I think that is a productive

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
use of time. So you know since we're here on this earth we're not just you know one

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
person living one life in League One little bubble trying to make sure that we all

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
interact with each other. And really go on to something more

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
progressive than what we're living right now. Because at the end of the day you know when we grow

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
older we have kids and we have to leave the world a better place than what it was before

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
because if we haven't done that then we've not progressed people at all and I

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
think that's what we need to start doing now. And with

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
. Last night the president's State of the Union address he was talking about you know in a

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
couple months we're going to go to Mars. I'm so excited that I got to live

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
through that I got to you know I'm living through having a

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
African-American president.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000
I'm living through you know hopefully maybe seeing Hillary in the White House. These are

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000
life changing things that I'm living through and living through people getting to

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Mars.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
This is a progressive use of our time of exploring what's out there and

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
also progressive use of science and technology to try to make people's lives better

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
and I think that's what we need to move out of people.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000
It's great I think it's a beautiful when it's all just. Individuals starting

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
out a small internet you anything you put that together is

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
going. Well I really want to

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
thank you for sharing your story and spend and spend inspiring for me. My voice

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
is a little worse for me to listen to you and I'm sure that it will inspire

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.000
others and. I. Do you know

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
anything else that you want to say any questions anything. Anything else that you want to make

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
sure is on the record before I pressed on

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:45.000
I just hope whoever is like listen to this like really takes it into

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
themselves and. Sort of looks at how can I change the world

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
in my own little place in my own little niche in my own little community and I think that's.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000
The last thing I want to say. Great wonderful. So you

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000
know as you brought up an object here today can you tell me a little bit about it and why

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
they brought it.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Well I bought a pair of my old glasses and I brought them because

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000
I think. The fact I mean. My glasses are the ones I've actually seen everything

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:21.000
that I go through as a student with A.D.D. they actually you know I wear them on my face

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000
and. Besides me seeing the world as I do they see

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000
the world as I do so I think hopefully with the picture that you're going to take of my

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
glasses someone can see the world like I do. I thought you know it's sort of

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
a quirky thing to print because not everybody wears glasses but since we're

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000
all different and like glasses are different on everybody else everyone has a different pair.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Mike there is how I see the world. Hopefully my option is

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000
inspirational enough for people to wake up and grab their own pair of glasses

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
and realize you know we all see the world differently but it's one world. It's

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
one vision that we have. So let's make the vision greater and brighter

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:10.000
and more progressive. And I think that's why I brought my glasses because

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000
besides me living what I have been living through my glasses have also been there with me

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000
seeing what I lived through those glasses can talk

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000
I know they can talk they're probably you know going to say I've

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
been broken a couple of times.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
She doesn't take care of me at all.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Oh you know they're a little bit broken a little bit on even and you know

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.000
on the sides of them we have a little sparkly. I'm very girly

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
but. I think if they can say something they would

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:50.000
really talk about the struggle that I went through or the struggle I'm going through

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000
now. Now does a city with a disability but just as a person as a whole

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:59.000
. Everyone has their own you know different type of struggle. But I

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
. Think if they could speak they would probably do a better job of

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
telling my story than I would if it would be you know as a third person perspective

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:14.000
I mean B. C. you know what does she do on a regular day.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
And I think. That seeing my vision

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:23.000
. And seeing the vision that I do have. And

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:29.000
you know bringing these glasses and you. Can sort of help other people

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
. And sort of give them the correct information which is what glasses are supposed to

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:34.000
do anyways.
