00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello my name is Lynne Luxton and I am going to have a conversation with

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Annamarie Kaplon for the Visible Lives in Oral History Project.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
At the New York Public Library. It

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is Thursday June the 11th, 2015. And

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
this is being recorded at the Andrew Heiskell Braille and Talking Book Library

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In New York City. Annamarie, thank you for coming. And why don't you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
start off and tell us a little something about yourself.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
OK thank you for inviting me. My name is Annamarie Kaplon.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I am 58 and a half years old. I'm diagnosed.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
From 1987 with retinitis

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
pigmentosa. Umm, When I was first diagnosed I I thought it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
was a very slow progressive blinding disease. I had

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
My two children at ages thirty two and thirty four. And by forty

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I was using a cane so I guess ignorance is bliss.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Because I don't know if I would have had children if, because I thought long slow progressive, I'd be

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
so I'd be any where between 70 and 80. I started out with a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
cane I remember walking one day my children to school and having to get back

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
alone. And it was so difficult that my first thing to do was to come in

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and I called the Helen Keller

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
School for the Blind, because I was already registered with the Commission. So I said. I'm

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
going to need

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
help and they helped me. Within a day or so I had a mobility instructor at the

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
house which

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
changed a lot in my world. And she, we, walked for two three weeks at

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
a time. Canes, subways, buses,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Restaurants, steps, church, wherever I go. And it was a great big

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
help I think it was

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
easier for my kids to see that I

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
was mobile. Mobile. I didn't want them to think

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
life was going to pass me by. And I made a conscious effort

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to decide whether I raise my

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
children or sit back and have someone else do it because I was afraid. and

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I didn't want that. So you bite the bullet. And you move on. That's how I felt.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I remember having a conversation with my mother right before I was getting the cane.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And I says to her, you know I'm getting a cane and she says to me

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
What? You're going to tap your way in the street? I'll help

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
you and I told her no. I says No, cause you are busy

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
at the senior center, you go on day trips you go on weekends. I don't want to rely on

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
you for container of milk or a loaf of bread.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I've gotta do it. My kids get sick. I gotta go to the drugstore. I gotta do what I gotta do.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And that's how I started

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
saying. Figure it out and go. Well,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
years past, of course. You know vision got progressively

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
worse. All facial recognition was gone. Reading was gone.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Color was gone.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And I went from cain to a seeing eye dog.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Not for any other reason other than I

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
was walking down the street with two kids. Pocketbook flung over my shoulder. Kid holding

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
holding one string of the cane. The other kid holding my hand, and I went "boy, do I look like a target."

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I said

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
so I thought the dog would give me a little bit more sense of security. So

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I opted to go to a dog. My

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
first dog was with Freedom Guide.  A yellow lab named

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Jedi.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And boy did we travel. He was excellent.  Excellent.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
From subway to buses to restaurants. To school. To school trips with the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
kids to open house to P.T.A. meetings to working fundraisers at the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
kids' school.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
But, you know, again, as the kids got older you were less needed to go to these

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Places with them. I always thought I needed to be with them but they were.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
You know pretty much going "you don't have to come, Mom"  You know...

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And that was

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
another experience in my life to have to go "Hmmm," I

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I don't think they need me to go with them anymore. And through all of this of course.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Life changes and my husband passed away when I was forty nine. So now I'm raising for

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
a fourteen and a sixteen year old.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And I don't. *Phone ringing* "cut" Sorry for the interruption.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.000
umm, I had

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
a fourteen and sixteen year old. And I just went, "Oh

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
My God, I've got to do this right." There

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
was you know, As kids today there was no father figure for a

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
boy and I was really concerned about that, but my daughter and I were like

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
so totally on him he didn't have a shot to turn back. He really didn't. 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and they did well. They did well. I'm very proud of them. I'm proud of myself

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
but getting them to the points of being college graduates with masters

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and B A's and good jobs and good

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
people who, um, help people.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I'm very proud of them. You know.? And I have to tell you, sometimes I'm proud of myself. Cool. Good job.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Good job. You know. I then had to get another dog, which is very

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
traumatic. 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Because my Jetty got old and arthritic. And I've got now, as of today,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
My black lab named Hobbes. Also from Freedom Guide. 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I was also given the opportunity to work at the Helen

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Keller School for the Blind. With the

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
babies from ages I think they go from 1 to 5. On the third floor,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Doing pet therapy. And that has been so great to watch them grow and when

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
they come back to the school. And you see them and they're like 13 and 14 years old and they'll 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
look at you and go.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I remember Jedi, I remember you sang...  So good to see

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
them grow. You look at then and go

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
wow. How big they got!  And

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000
again the Helen Keller School was my savior. And I speak their praise.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
To anybody who would listen to me. They. They helped me. And when

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
they offered me the position to volunteer.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
it was my way of giving back. And I went

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
great and then of course they got some kind of a grant and they said we could pay you and I said even better.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So what the heck.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And that is been continuing now from one day a week to 2 days a week from

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
an hour a week to 2 hours a week. So that's where I'm at now. And it's great. And

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
these babies are so cool. With their little canes and they are going to be so great in

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
the world and

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I don't know what people did years ago they just sat home I don't...I can't even imagine.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I never gave myself the time to feel

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
sorry for myself. I wouldn't allow that.   It was just me. I

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
couldn't do my own pity party. I had things to do. I had children

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
to raise as young, and they had children to take care of. After my husband

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
died. And you learn different things because when there's a person

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
with you. He did the bills. He wrote out the checks. I'm going back,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We were not very computer savvy people.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So, you know, it was hard. So I went, oh, I have to 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
do this. I have to do the income tax. OMG! I don't know how to do income

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
tax. OK, pack it all up, find an accountant. Worked it out. 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Financial aid papers for college. I don't know how to fill those out. 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I've never done it. I didn't go to college. Didn't do it. I went OK pack that

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
up, find someone, go to find an accountant. Bring all your...

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Bring all you... there's a way. You just gotta think about it, and

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
not let it overwhelm you, because blindness is scary. Blindness

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
is... it it doesn't change who are, it just cramps your 

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
style a little bit. You are who you are. You just go

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
a little slower. You have to think about it a little bit. 

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Anything spontaneous. You normally going to bump your head or get burned or something.  So you have to go

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
little slow.  You have to have a little bit of a plan. You have to know. I mean I have cooked dinner

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
for

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
10, 12 people on holidays and whatever. And when they tell that to

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
people they go. You cook? Yeah, I cook. 

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
The kids have to eat. I have to eat. It's part of life. You eat.  You eat. You eat. OK?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And I would cook for like from Friday to Saturday, let's say, if it was a Sunday holiday.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And then when everybody came over, it would all be hot and cooking in the oven, no heating and whatever, and I would tell

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
people Look I cook it. I can't serve it with all these people because I'm going to hit somebody in the

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
head. And I think the more open you are with your blindness and what

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
you can and cannot do

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Makes people understand you a little bit better. You know people are, I think people in

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
general

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
are afraid of blind people who are blind. Like, oh my God, 

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.000
they're blind. Oh my God! How do I talk to them? (?)

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
People will, sitting in a restaurant, will look at your companion and go

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
What does she want? (laughs)

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Hello? I can speak! You can talk to me.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I don't bite! You're not going to catch it.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
You know. It's... I think you

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
to project that. Because if you come off going "oh, I don't know..."

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Let me see, I don't know, can you do that for me?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
They'll look at you like, Oh my God, You poor thing.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And I never wanted to be defined as That Poor Thing!

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Look at Her!  You know? I wanted to be known as the women that they went...

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Oh yeah, she shops, she comes in here, we help her out, she comes with the dog, she gets around,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
she goes into the city, she hops on Access-a-Ride, she does what she needs to do.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
 And I wanted my children to know that. I guess

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:26.000
they were the ones that kept me focused. They kept me going.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I can't break.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Because they got to know to be strong. I don't know if this eye disease passes on to them.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
them. I hope it starts and ends with me. I don't know. I don't know down

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
the road. Children, grandchildren, where this goes.  Don't have a clue.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And I don't think about it because if you think about it you could lose your

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
mind. And I decided that I needed my children

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
to say oh mom just doesn't see, but she's good. She's good. If she needs help she'll ask.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
she'll ask but most of the time she figures it out. And my children's

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
friends from when they were young. Just like "Annamarie...

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Oh, Annamarie, how you doing? It's me. It's Mary, it's Lauren, it's, it's James.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
they weren't afraid. And they grew up with it. and they'll see me on

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
the street and go hey how you doing Annamarie, it's Allison's friend, blah blah blah blah blah. 

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
You know?  Whereas most people go "Oh, 

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
You don't want me to help you cross that street? No I'm find, but

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
But if you'd to tell me when the light changes. "Oh you poor thing."

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I don't feel like a poor thing.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I don't want to be known as that poor woman who lost her vision.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I want to be known as "Oh look, there's the blind lady with the dog. And I think that's what I am

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
in the neighborhood. Like people ask me

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Are you training that dog? And I go oh no, he's blind and I go

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
You're blind? And I go Yes. Is that a blind dog? (interviewer laughs)

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And I go oh I hope not.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
They gave me the wrong dog! And it's like, Oh my God! ??

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I think you project who you are. If you're angry

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
at your situation. People are going to avoid you because you come off bitter

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
bitter and angry. If you look at the world as a whole picture.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
This just cramps your style. Doesn't change anything.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I can't talk about other issues and people who are blinded. Other ailments. I can't even imagine.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
But just being blind. You know, you do things a little differently.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
But you're up and about and you're

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
out. OK. I'll tell you a funny story.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
When I first got my first seeing eye dog, my 

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Jetty, you know, the training. You know the training was difficult and of

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
course it's. it's very intense. And one day I left the house and going to get the

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000
kids at school, they were still in grammar school. And I said to my parents who lived downstairs from

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
me in the basement. So I'm leaving. I'm going to get the kids from school so

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
my father goes to me and my mother, "Who you going with?"

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I'm with the dog. 

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And they were all, "You can't go with the dog!" 

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I said, No I'm going with the dog. They went, "She's going with the dog! What is she doing?. She's going with the...

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
OK; I'm walking to school and I'm crossing my streets and I'm

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
doing what I have to do. And my dog Jetty wasn't

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
acting right

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000
right. I'm like, he keeps to turning around and turning around and 

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
turning

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Til I found out later that night.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
That my father followed me in his car. (interviewer laughs) 

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Watching me cross the streets. And Jetty knew my father; knew

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
the car. And just going, Oh maybe I should get in that car.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
So finally that night, I says to him...

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Something just wasn't.. didn't feel right. So I says, you know,  I went with the kids and

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.000
I went to pick them up and the dog was acting kind of funny and I says to him. Were you in your car?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So now my father who was a very thick-Italian-accented man, went like this...

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I'm no know what are you talking about? 

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
(interviewer laughs) I said, were you in the car following me?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And he says to me. This is a free country. He says to me, I can go into my

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
car anywhere. And go where I want to go. I said, well you're never doing

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
that again. Because you distracted the dog. You can't do

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
that. I was trying to cross streets. And he was not concentrating.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Because he was looking at you!

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
at you. Uh! I can go where I want to go. You're going to tell me where I can

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
go? Uh! I don't know what you're talking about. I said, Oh, this will never do.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Never ever do. I says so from now on, I said,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I will not tell you people when I'm leaving. If you want to come up to my apartment and not find me there

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
and get worried, that's up to you. I said, But you can't do that. 

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
I hope you live to be 110 years old, but you're not.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And I gotta go on my own.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Believe me, it is frightening. I walk out of the house every day and

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
go, Dear Father God, you 

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
must get me where I got to go, and get

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:22.000
home. And when I walk into my door and shut that door, it's like that sigh of relief. 

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Goes, ah! home base! This is good! Oh, I did it! This is good. And every day.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
is the same thing. OK I'm good today. Let me just get there I got to go, Lord, 

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and get me

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
back and. That's my way of staying focused.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:43.000
But the thing with my mom and dad was just hysterical. Just hysterical.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and they, I go no, I'm going with the dog. "She's going with the dog!" How could she go with the dog?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
You think we should go with her? Oh no, we won't go with her, we'll just stay. I'm like, 

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Oh my God, they're losing... they're making me nuts! And you know unfortunately Dad

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
passed away about 6 years ago. And Mom is, to this date, 

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
99 years old. Alzheimer dementia. 

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
You want them around forever; they're not going to be.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
So the only person you can rely on is you. You want your kids to stay

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
young forever because they'll walk down the street holding your hand saying No, Mom, THIS is 

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
the store.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
It's not going to happen. They have got to move on with their lives. And I have had

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
to allow them to move on with their lives and not feel that

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
they can't: A,move out of state because they have a blind mother. Oh, never.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
never.  Never happen. Or they can't go on vacation because

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Mom may need to go somewhere. Oh, no. 

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Not me. Absolutely not me. that wasn't going to be me. And

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I wasn't going to allow them...  Look, I know they're there for me if I need them in a heartbeat.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000
But they've got to live their lives. Get married, have children and move

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
on. Stay within the boroughs. I can get on Access-a-Ride, I can get to the boroughs.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
You move to another state, uh, I'll figure that out. 

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
it out.You know it just takes a little

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
time. As for, um, like

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
special things I do at home. I rubber band things that I want that

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
I know which is shampoo, which is a conditioner.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
My clothes. The devices out there today are fabulous. I don't know what people did back

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
a hundred years ago.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Everything in my house. Bings and bangs, talks, beeps.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:43.000
crows the watch, whatever.  You know. Tells me my color, tells me my time.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
I'm not as computer savvy as I'd like to be. But I'm

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
trying.  I'm trying to come into this 21s century.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
I get there. I could get an e-mail. I could

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
forward it and I could do a little searching of the web and download a couple of things but I'm definitely

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
not like the kids of today. But

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
again, I got things that read my mail.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
It is not easy to be blind. But it's definitely a hell of a

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
lot easier than it was years ago, where the only thing you

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
had to do was Braille. And I'm a terrible Braille user. I could do a

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
basic

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
A.B.C. Book 2? Uh, I don't know. 

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
know. Maybe one of these days. Maybe it'll be in my bucket list. I don't know. 

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Um, I have travelled. I've gone to Italy

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
about 5 years ago with my sister to visit family. And we went to the Italy

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Of where my father grew up. And my sister was a great great

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
vocal tour guide.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
She explained. Every nook cranny, cobble-street hill, 

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
The the view of of Naples and the bay and Vesuvius and Capri,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
And we'd be standing on like this promenade looking over. And she said to me do you

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
remember the picture daddy had of Naples?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
You know, with the boats in the Mediterranean?  I said Absolutely.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
She says

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
This is the absolute picture. This is it. You can't be more exact,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
She says that if you remember that picture this is what we're looking at. And I saw it. 

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
When we went to Pompeii. And we saw the ruins of Pompeii she described it to me.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
And there was also I headset that you could have listened to when walking. But there was a feel.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:39.000
and I got it. and I didn't... I was a little leery about going; I'm going to spend all this money

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
and I can't see

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
can't see anything. What I am gonna... but there was a feel. And it was

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000
good and the street where my father grew up on. And the house he grew up

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
in and... I left the dog home and used my cane

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
and, you know for, for Europe.  And obviously being blind

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
is a commodity in Europe. Thing cause every line we got on, they said

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
They said to us. Come come; signore, veni, veni.  you don't have to wait. Veni! Veni!  

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
I went, whoa!

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
This is good! I was a commodity!

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And my sister goes, I don't have to pay either? They went, no!

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
They went, no, you're her companion! Oh, OK! So we laughed. 

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Of course, all of a sudden I came in handy. My cousins wanted to know

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000
know, in Italy, if I could leave them a cane. So when they wanted to come in 

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
some place, they would just pretend they were blind, and I went, no. 

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
And went, no, no, no, they went OK. And it 

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
just a wonderful experience. Wonderful to just

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
be there and just.... I've never been to Europe before so this was a 

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
a chance of a lifetime

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:53.000
experience. I have traveled on cruises with friends.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Um, Vegas, uh, Washington.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
And I have met more kind

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
people. Again, I haven't traveled alone. I'm not... I'm...I'm brave but I'm not THAT brave. 

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
There are more people willing to help than not. When you get to a hotel and someone walks you in,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
they'll get you up and take you to your rooms. You want to come out and go to the desk,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
there's more than enough

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
hands. But again. I also think that that's when

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
you project yourself as someone who

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
is nice.  You don't think you're entitled.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:33.000
And I think that people sometimes who are blind think they have a sense of entitlement.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And they're angry. And they project that. And I think when

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I see that in some blind people that bothers me. That bothers...they're angry. 

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
They're angry. They have a right to be angry. I get angry I get

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
But I don't let

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
it eat me. You

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
just can't. You die. If you expel this kind of... If I expel

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
If I expel this much energy trying to be this

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
angry, I can't do it. But that's me. That's me. So

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:08.000
I think when you come off and you ask people and you're kind. Instead of standing on the corner

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
going WHO'S GOING TO HELP ME CROSS THIS STREET?

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Not me! If I was... If you had vision, would you do? I wouldn't do it. 

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
But if you stand there and go "excuse me, can someone just let me know if I have the light?"

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
There are more kind people than not in this world. And

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
so what's going to be 20 years from now?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Who knows? A new dog? 

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Some grandchildren maybe? If I ever get so lucky. I'm going to be the oldest grandma

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000
grandma in history. Um, A little more traveling maybe with friends

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
and family.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.000
family. And I guess my goal right now is to just see my kids settled

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
in nice relationships, I'd like that, or anything that makes them happy. Because you know.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000
With kids what you want and what they want are

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
always two different things. As long as they're

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
So I'm done. That's me. That's great! Is that okay? 

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Is that OK? That is wonderful. Is... are there 

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
any kinds of things that you would like to say that in the future

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000
future when people listen to you and listen to this, that you think are really important? 

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
You've spoken eloquently. Thank you. About how important it is to 

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
be yourself. And 

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
And to project a positive image. Is there anything else that...

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:37.000
In the future... let me think

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.000
OK.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
OK you can turn it on. I'll think of something. Yes. 

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000
You know. There is so much going

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
on in technology today

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
that. I don't know if blindness will, I don't know, maybe a hundred years

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
maybe 100 years from now is not something they can't possibly cure. 

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
They probably can't. Anything artificial, anything

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Computerized in the chip. And you've got to have some kind of 

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.000
hope to hold onto. The only thing I can tell people who are going through the beginnings

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
of visual impairment and vision loss.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Seek help.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Go to the professionals. This is not something you can deal with on

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000
your own whether you go to Helen Keller, whether you go to the Jewish

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Guild, whether you go to the library. Whether you go to Visions. Whatever is out there in

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
your community.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
You must get the help you

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
need to be who you are. Because if you go like this: "I'm

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
never leaving my house."  You're not going to be... you can't do that. There are people out

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
there who will help you. See the doctors that are out there. New devices.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
New things are coming out every day. Maybe not in your case, maybe not

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
in your lifetime.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
But they'll fix it.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
That's my thought. My thought is that they're going to fix these eyes one of these days. Maybe

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
not for me. That's OK.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
But if they need me to try different things out, I'm more

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
than willing to go get, take the shot.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:22.000
I would experiment. I think.  Depending on how invasive it is.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
I would try different techniques. I would try different technology,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
equipment. I was asked to do it.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
tryout for something that's coming out of

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Israel. Um, it was a great little device. I think they're on

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
the right track. I think it needs more work. And I sat with

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
these scientists for, um, a couple hours one day about a year ago. It

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
was great.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
It's... but it wasn't going to give me what I needed

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
On the outside. It was only going to help me fit in my home. I didn't need help in my home. I know my home.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
But you've gotta... anyone who was going blind, or has anything in their family.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
They must get professional advice. And they must seek out the people who can help

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
them retrain their whole

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000
lifestyle. Terrific.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. 

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Thank you.
