00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello, my name is Christina Ladas and I'm going to have a conversation

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with Alexandria Economou for Visible Lives an

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
oral history project at the New York Public Library. It is February

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
8th, 2015 and this is being recorded in my studio

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in Muttontown, Long Island, New York.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Hi, Alexandria.  Hi, Christina.  Tell me

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
about your earliest memories.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Well, I grew up in Queens and I spent a lot of time with my grandparents

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
when- while my mom was working.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You know that was a very happy time for me. Uh, but there was

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
also always blood tests and doctors' appointments or

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
something medical going on. I- you know, for me, my

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
earliest memories are more of a stream of consciousness. "um" It's very

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Hard for me to separate out single events. It's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
become almost like a giant snowball.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I can no longer see the individual snowflakes... Interesting

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Who do you trust or believe in then? Uh, at this time

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I didn't trust or believe in anybody. Um,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I was more like a wild animal, fighting for my life, fighting to survive

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
while I was going through different medical situations.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Can you talk about your disability?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I had a kidney transplant when I was a baby

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and many other complications through the years. I've had

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
many orthopedic surgeries on my legs. I use a wheelchair,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
have low vision, and learning disabilities.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
What were you most afraid of when you were little? The so-called biggest monster under your

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
bed?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Well, actually, my monster didn't live under my bed. It was as big

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
as a hospital. Actually it was the hospital and, uh, the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
entrance doors reminded me of a giant mouth.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You were the only disabled student in your school from kindergarten to third grade. What was that like?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Well, actually the laws for inclusion that

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
allowed me to be in a school for able-bodied students actually

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
excluded me, personally. "um"... How?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It was 100% inaccessible; you know, it was an old building,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
there were stairs everywhere. "um" My mother and custodians had to

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
carry me in in my wheelchair and I, you know, I wasn't allowed to

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
move around the building because of safety reasons. "uh"

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
You know I remained in a classroom until the end of the day when they carried me out.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
"um" I didn't really learn anything. Mainly,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
you know, I guess you could say I learned about was

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
isolation and loneliness... In fourth grade you went to a different

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
school.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Can you talk about that?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
In fourth grade, I went to a school where the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
other students had, uh, physical disabilities or were medically

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
fragile and for the first time there was more of my kind.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Um, you know, I wasn't the only one. And actually

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
compared to some of the students, I was more able-bodied.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
"um" You know, no longer

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
needing to be carried out during a fire drill. "um" I was actually

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
able to push the wheelchairs of other students and that was very empowering.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
[paper shuffling]

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I know that horses are central in your life,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
How did that come about? "uh" When I was about eight years old my family

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
found theraputic horseback riding. Um, you know,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
we had to get doctors to sign papers and

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Just OK different things and have an evaluation at the barn.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
"um" The first time I actually rode, I screamed and cried the whole time.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And I think that was because it was the first time that I was

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
ever really out of my wheelchair, moving, and that was terrifying.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
but it actually, it didn't last long. "um"

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
You know, knowing that every Sunday I would be with horses. It was

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
something to look forward to... Why?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Because, um, horses, they didn't judge me or

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
ignore me they just accepted me. And soon "uh"

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
uh, horses and riding it became the center of my life and

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
everything else got in my way and it kept me away from the barn... What

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
was the prospect of graduation and going to college like?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Graduation and college was terrifying and surreal.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
"uh" You know when you're when you go to a

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
school, that is "100" percent accessible and

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
is able to accommodate your needs. "um" The idea of

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
having to leave that safe place was just so scary. You know I wasn't

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
sure how I was going to fit into college, if I could do it, you know, I was still

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
recovering from major surgery. So it was just all very scary.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
What were you like at this point? What did you trust or believe in?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Well at this time, uh, my horseback riding, um, actually

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
included competition

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And, actually I had.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Taken a grand champion in my division at the Hampton Classic

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
only a week before starting college. And, uh, you know, on that first

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
day rolling into a classroom of "30" staring

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
students, you know, where I was the only, uh, wheelchair in the

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
room was a little, I was a little

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
unsure, but, uh, then I was thinking to myself, you know, I'm the only grand champion

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
in the room and that was cool. "um"

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It was exciting. "um" "uh" You know it was exciting because I actually

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
started to believe in myself and I was starting to connect

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
to a definite spirituality.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Why was it exciting?... "um" Because I was able to see

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
the possibility "uh" you know I wasn't, I was able

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
to start seeing myself as a whole. "uh" You know not just

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
broken bits of this and that.  You're pursuing an

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
interesting career.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Can you talk about it?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Yes. I am studying animal-assisted therapy

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
working with dogs on Long Island and horses in Tucson.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
. "uh"

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
My plan/goal is to work with kids who have physical

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
disabilities, uh, that have a similar journey to my own

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
because I bring an interesting perspective to it and, uh, you know these

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
animals have always been drawn to me

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and I feel they can help, uh, people with

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
disabilities come out of their dark hiding place.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I know that you are a creative person. Tell me about that.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.000
.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Well I'm a Reiki Master, uh, I'm a potter. You know

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I work in the old way, meaning alternate firing. I

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
just love having my hands in the clay. I think that's because, uh,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
clay holds ancient knowledge and this is something that our ancestors

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
knew. Um,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I'm a poet and I love performance.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
I make jewelry and amulets for musicians.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
You've been through so much. What makes you keep going?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Well, I would have to say it's possibility. Uhm...

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
hope, you know that's the last thing that, uh, people have to

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
hold onto, and I would say that doctors should never

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
forget that. And, you have to have hope.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Uhm, and you know, as I got older

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I figured out that, uh, disability doesn't define you. It's

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
just part of who you are.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
It's, it's part of me as a whole.  It's not separate from me.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
What challenge have you conquered? Hmm, I would have to say

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
fear, um, because fear is my biggest

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
opponent in my existence.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I, you know, it's like flying against the wind or

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
endless falling into the black hole. You know, with nothing to grab

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
onto, um. But you know every time that I am able to

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
pull myself back into the light, uh, it's just

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
another, another victory for me. But you know

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
this warrior spirit here, it knows that it's not the last battle.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
There will always be something coming up, some sort of fear. What are you most proud

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
of? I would have to say, getting out of my

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
wheelchair, which is hard. Getting into my saddle, which

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
is even harder. You know, uh, the amazing horse people

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
that I work with have to be really creative at times to help

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
me get into my saddle to ride, and they've been

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
so creative at times. I have a whole team working with me you, uh

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
know and working with a difficult horse, and then all of a

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
sudden just everything falls into place. It comes together so nicely.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.000
.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
What message do you want a listener to keep?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
People are faceted like gemstones.  Turn almost

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
any one and the light will catch on

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
something beautiful, or unexpected. Don't hate

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
us, uh, you know. Don't break our hearts for no reason. Don't pity us.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Just give us a chance. Thank you

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Alexandria. Thank you.
