00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I am here recording at the J.C.C. Center Lines special needs fair, my name is Diane Campione

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
recording for visible lives. I'm sitting here with Jeanette Solomon. Hi Jeanette, who are you

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
speaking about today? I'm speaking about my daughter Lana. And learn attends what school?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
?Wrinkles? high school

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Tell me what made you suspect that Lana was different? When she born, she had

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
medical and health issues from the start. So they thought it was genetic.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
She was very sickly, ?inaudible?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
she had ?inaudible?, but when time came the medical issues

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
got better and they ended up diagnosing 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
her on the autism spectrum. And at what age was that?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
At about 16 months. Tell me about the day Lona was diagnosed.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
What was that like?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Well it was more of a relief to get a diagnosis, I finally have a name

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
To say she had something, so we could get a treatment plan. Because I was starting from

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
not knowing. So every day I was living in fear of not knowing. They kept talking medical

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
reasons she had this. I thought, I thought

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
it was more of a relief when I knew what it was and then I

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
knew what we could do to help it. And what was her

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
classification? they classified her autism. They started off P.D.D

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
started of you know, they put her in right away, 20 hours of  A.D.A therapy

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
?inaudible?, speech, O.T and P.T, so our days were basically 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Mondays through Fridays, therapies all day long.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
How would you describe your emotions after the initial diagnosis?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Probably from the shock for a while of everything I had to do. It felt like

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
my whole life just revolved around her, and I really didn't get a break to probably

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
think too much, so I really ran on autopilot, I think for the first year

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
or 2 with her.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And what word you say best describes the difficult stages of Lona's

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
disability ?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Probably between the ages of 4 and 8

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
when we were working on body training, and it wasn't going well, we had a lot of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
of a, smearing incidents as we would call it, and that went on for quite a few years 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
so, very difficult times. And any time I took her anywhere she would get very nervous

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and throw up. (Chuckles) So I was living between

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
one mess to another mess not matter where I was. And what would you say the biggerest

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
obsticcal was to overcome. Well she's Non-verbal. So, Communication.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Once we started to work on a device, and getting her to be able to tell us

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
her needs, her behaviors got so much better.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So probably between 10 and up it went -it just skyrocketed. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Her behaviors got so much better.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Because now she could tell us what she wanted, how she felt.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
She's typing now you know telling us her needs and her wants.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So... its been a relief since

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You know. Do you ever feel as they gave up your life to get a Lona

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
a life? Well I never went back to work,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
so basically I have, my

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.000
life has been revolved around her, and helping her and and I got involved with

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
her school, so I can be involved and know what's going on, and help all the kids more

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So that's my life. I've been volunteering and advocating. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Do you ever did you ever ask why?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I did, I questioned it. You know, I got mad. I had anger issues in between. You know, why 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
me, why me? You know, something I just learned it's

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
what I have and I just have to deal with it and make the best of it. And you know what

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
been easy, and once I accepted that fact it made it easier for me.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Is there something that you would like the public to know that individuals with autism?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I think a lot of known individuals with autism ,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
communication is one of their hardest issues and if you can break through that barrier, you know

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
it's much easier for them, and they can do so much

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
more than you ever though. That's what I have seen: just so much more than I ever believed

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
doing now.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Absolutely. Can you finish this sentence for me. I draw my strength from

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I draw my strength from my daughter, and watching her go through her struggles and her accompishments.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I really do, and seeing how strong of a person she is has made me strong. 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Your story is inspiring and I want to thank you for sharing her story with me.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Thank you for taking the time to be interviewed it's going to be an important fact that the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
public know that, individuals like this and and because of you I feel much more

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
educated. Thank you so much.
