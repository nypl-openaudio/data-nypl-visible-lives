00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Texas, yeah, I was born there since I was a little kid. And I have my

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Grandma, my Mom, and my sister and especially my

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I mess up or now? There we go, perfect. So, if you could

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
ah tell me a little bit about what you remember about Texas

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
ahhh, I used to see my Dad a lot and it used to be warm down there and my mom

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I love my mom, so

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, I see my grandma sometimes and my Aunt ?Gwen

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Yeah. I miss them a lot. And

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
what was it like to move to Staten Island? Ah, we didn't have ?service down there in Texas

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
so we came New York. First we came, lived in Brooklyn and then we came up here in Staten Island.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Right.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And tell me about what school was like for you. Did you go to which

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
grades did you go to in Texas.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Ahh, a lot of schools in Texas. Maybe a few, I was young. And maybe

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
ah, when I came up here my first school was Brooklyn. H.I.C.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Okay. Then I started New York, then Wagner, then I went to ?Hunterford that's my last school

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
last school. OK. Yeah. OK, So what was a middle school like?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It was good, like, you know my teacher from ?Hunterford

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
?Hunterford used to teach me a lot of stuff from, from the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
the war and stuff and the fighting. The people

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
killing when they wanted America or something. I remember, yeah.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Um, and I'm going to ask you some questions that Diane prepared

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So, if you could tell me a little bit about what makes you different from other individuals?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I don't know I don't look to different.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Sometimes I have a scar on my stomach from I was

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
surgery as a little kid. I used to choke on food so I was different

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Like, when I was a little kid, I had surgery right here [background noise]

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I couldn't like, like I couldn't talk, I was a little kid

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
kid and they taught me. And, when I was a little kid, I had surgery took a

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
while to chew and eat, stuff like that. So people don't

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
think I'm different cause I don't look different cause if I was different, they would know, you know

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000

So a. Famous poet Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote that the

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Pain.
