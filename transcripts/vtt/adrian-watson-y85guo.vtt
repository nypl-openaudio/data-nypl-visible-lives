00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hello my name is Catherine Parker, and I'm going to have an interview

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
conversation, I should say, more like a conversation with

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Adrian Watson, for Visible Lives: An Oral History Project at the New York Public

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Library.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It is January 21st, 2015, and this is being

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
recorded at City College, in Manhattan.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So Adrian, can you tell me

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
about where you come from.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Well. I was born in New York City uh

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
actually I was born at home, um

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So you know ... that's basically, you know ... pretty much I was

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
raised here, um,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You know, I grew up in up in New York City, pretty much, went to school

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
New York City my whole life I have lived here um

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I mean New York city is pretty much my home, I mean that's 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
thats the place that I know, I mean I grew up, you know up

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
town, in Harlem um

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a. You know I went to school, I met a lot of great friends and a lot of great

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
people. You know. I-I've been able to receive a pretty

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
decent education. Considering um the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
schools that I went to, like PS 146 and 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And um Junior High School 117 as well

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
as well as Mary Bircham they were all wheelchair accessible, which

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
was great becase I didn't have to worry about how I was

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
going to be able to navigate around school and um

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
. You know overall I have enjoyed my life

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
you know, like I said everything was

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
pretty much you know set up for me growing up, you know

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
PS 146, they had services that I needed, they had a para professional 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
for me, they had, uh

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Physical and occupational therapy available

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and um I was a mainstream student

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Although I do have a disability, I've always been mainstream

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
growing up during my elementary,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
junior high and high school years. And um

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
One of the things that my family always taught me is to never

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
use my disability as an excuse not to excel. um...

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
They always told me to do my best.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And to you know. Not let my disability

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
hold me back. They would hold me accountable, If for example

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
I didn't do as well as they knew I could, you know, and

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
my schoolwork and I was pretty much neck and neck with

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
my sister in terms of grades and you know

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
so on. um I have a twin sister and I

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
um I have an older sister. Actually I have many older

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
sisters, who have you know really helped to

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
encourage me throughout my life and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
um If it wasn't for them, alot of the times I

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
probably would have been discouraged because I have gone through

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.000
that.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
It hasn't been easy, um, but they've always

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
been there to tell me "Hey Jane, you know, you could do this. We want

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
you to do your best. um and we don't want anything.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Try to deter you from, you know, accomplishing your

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
dreams." um

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
It's been really helpful to me throughout my life

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000
is my faith in my lord and savior, Jesus Christ um

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
God is, you know, without him again I wouldn't be

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
be able to um do the things that I do

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I actually believe that he gives you the strength to wake up.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And to just do all the things that I'm

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
able to do in my life. I belive if it wasn't for him

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I wouldn't even be here, I mean I feel that

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
He has a plan for me and I feel that, you know he's gonna

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
continue to guide me throughout.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
my life's journey. You know, I- my faith

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 is really really what is the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
driving force behind me.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Honestly I mean I wake up in the morning saying "ok Jesus, you

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000
know.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Jesus I you gonna help me do you know whatever

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
it is that I need to do, whether it be just to be able to get up and go

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
take a shower or you know be able to ace

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that final exam, you know, whatever it is! And I,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
again, I think that faith is very important especially when you have a

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
disability because sometimes... I don't have

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
control over how my body moves and stuff like that

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
because of cerebral palsy, and

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I think that it's um... important to know that

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
even if you don't have control, God does have control and he can

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
help you in the areas that you physically just can't really

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
do much about. I mean things that people take

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
like being able to hold books open

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And hold an ice cream cone or something

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
like that, I find difficult at times, you know

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
because of my disability, you know, but, just

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
tapping into that faith and constantly thinking to myself

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I know God is gonna to make it better, even

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
... or even if its just a little bit, sometimes I pray to God and he gives

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
me just a little bit more strength to do what I need to do.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Whether it be grabbing on to something or

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
or, you know, being able to pass, you know,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
my exams or, you know, just getting into my

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
wheelchair in the morning - sometimes its a struggle, um... but

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
again is my faith and God, honestly keeps me going

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
really does. Do you go to a church around here?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Yes um, I actually attend First Sharon,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
um, which is on a hundred sixteenth Street.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Um... and I think that the people there are really

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
know me since i'm a Kid and they, you know they

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
try to basically cultivate you know

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
my faith as much as possible and remind me that no

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
matter how difficult things may get God is always, you know, he always

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
always has my back, and so that,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
you know, going to church and actually, you know,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
learning about God from my grandmother

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
just constantly like focus,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
you know, prayer and uh,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
you know, just trusting God i-it's a big, it's a big,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
it's a big help to me it really is, you know faith is-

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
is huge in my life. I wouldn't be able to like, I'm in

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
this society I

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
am in a National Society for leadership and success...

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
um, I currently have a 3.2...

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
seven -- I think -- GPA and

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I have 49 credits 

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
in college and I never thought that I would make it to this point

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
You know, with all that I have been through, you know, I don't

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.000
...

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I didn't think that half of this would be possible

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I honestly didn't. I mean, there were times where I just didn't think

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
that I will be able to manage, because sometimes I wake up

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
pain -- you know, physically, I've been through a lot of operations -- and

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
all kinds of things, things that would knock most people

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
down and make them say, "I just can't... you know I can't make it

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I don't want to go any further," you know? But for some reason God is

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
always giving me a little bit of uh... it's like he's

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
always just telling me, "Don't worry Adrian, you and me

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
know we've got this. If you can't do, it I can!" You know

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
what I'm saying? So... that,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
you know, I think faith is very,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
very, very important. I really do think

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
that faith is... is actually... is 

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
necessary. Like

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
to me it's almost as important as breathing, I mean if I

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I didn't have my faith or if God

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
be here tonight.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So I just thank God for everything... I really

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
do. Mhm.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Can you talk more about w-what you're doing here at City College?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Um...

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Well. I started off at City College, um...

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
wanting to be an education major -- I've always want to

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
teach. Um, I do work with some students here 

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I do do a little bit of tutoring here at times, um,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
So it kind of helps me sort of fulfill

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
had when I originally came here... but unfortunately I had to make some

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
changes to my major. Because I

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
discussed it with some of my school 

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
counselors at the disability offices at City

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
City College and um, like, Pat Bianchi,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
you know, spoke to me and we spoke about how, because of my

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
physical disability, you know, teaching in a classroom full of

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
children might be difficult at times.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And, um,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
you know we discussed me trying to find something that would be a

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
little bit more,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
how can I say this... like something I would be able to handle better

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
um, considering my physical disability and what I was able

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
to do. Um, She wanted to ensure that I would

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
be able to be the best at whatever I'm doing and not let my

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000
disability, sort of, like, you know,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
put like, any kind of, like, you know

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
shadow over it, you know, and to make sure in

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
whatever I do my disability is not gonna, like, hinder me, or

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
you know, um... how

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
can I put this...

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
um, just get in my way basically.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Um, and so

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I wanted to help people still, so I

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
decided that I would go into sociology because it's a pretty broad

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
field and you can, um,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
learn about how to work with people in communities

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
and you know possibly do a job

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
that, you know, surrounds the Christian faith, like maybe

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
be a minister or maybe work with, you know, kids that at

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
afterschool program, or you know I'm not sure exactly what

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I'm gonna do when I graduate but what I do know is that

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
I definitely want to serve others some way, you know?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Particularly, maybe, people with disabilities, I would like

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
to work with them and encourage them somehow you know

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
have a goal in life, so...

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Uh... so, can you talk about,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
uh...

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
like when you learned, um...

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
were you born with your disability?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Yes I was born with cerebral palsy.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Not really sure what the cause is of my disability, I believe it was

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
because of a loss of oxygen, but I'm really not sure.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And, because of cerebral palsy, I have had to

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
have many surgeries to try to correct the spasticity

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
that I suffer with in my muscles, um, to improve my

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
quality of life... and it's been a struggle because,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
you know, it's like, when it's not one thing it's another.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
But when you're dealing with cerebral palsy, it's like, I try to live my life almost...

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
it's almost as if I didn't have cerebral palsy, like, and I try not to

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
even let it... I try not to let it

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
influence

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
major parts of my life, I try not to

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
focus on it, you know, and make it be like a crutch,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
you know, and say to myself, "Oh well I can't do this because I have

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
cerebral palsy." I try to say, "Okay.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I have cerebral palsy but. You know I can do

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
this: like for example, if they make a way

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
for me to go in to a school or a building as long as it's accessible,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
you know, I can figure it out

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
some kind of way, you know. I don't let

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
disability stop me from doing anything that I wanna

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
do or accomplish... and for all of you out there listening

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
I wanna tell you: if you have a disability or even if you don't,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
you know, don't let anything stop you from accomplishing what you

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
wanna accomplish. Every day is not gonna be easy but

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
if you have faith in God, He can show that what

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
you can't do, He can! And that is what I...

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
that is... try-that's how I try to live my life,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
 you know, I try to live my life saying that, you know, I have a

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
disability, yes, but let's see how we can work around it some

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
kind of way,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
you know.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Always work around your disability, no matter what.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
So what have...Can you think of any specific examples of challenges that you

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
faced and then managed to get around?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
So many... where do I even start?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Like I said, I mean, I have difficulty with

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
something as simple as being able to hold the ice

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
cream cone with my left hand while I can drive

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
with my other hand... um, my left hand is, um,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
weaker and harder for me to control than my right hand and

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
so that makes it a little bit

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
things that people take for granted I struggle

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.000
with.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
I can't walk, and so, obviously, doing

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
things like being able to get up and just go use the restroom or,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
you know, things that people don't even think about like even getting out of

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
bed in the morning... I can't do that by myself, you know, I have to

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
depend on somebody to come and help me everyday and

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
that's not easy... it can be quite challengin, you know, it really

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
can.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
But, um, again, I just try to thank God for what I

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
do have, you know, because if I focus so much on what I don't have

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
then I'll get depressed, you know? So I focus on

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
what I do have as opposed to what I don't have, you know.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Because that way you can do a lot with what you have

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
. But when you... focus so much

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
on what you don't have or what you can't do, then you kind of

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:46.000
defeat yourself. To where you can't even do,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
you know, things that you

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
probably would have been able to do if only you, you know,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
realized what you were blessed with. I mean I,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
you know,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
So I have one hand that doesn't work so well that some people can't use

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
either word in their head and well I might not be able to move on but

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
at least my mind works well at least I can understand what's going

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
on around me and can you know take care of my

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
you know business market you know go to the

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
bank. I can you know come to school you know

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
come to college you know three days a week. Or

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
. You know I can go back and

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
it's you know so I try to focus on what it can do

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
and the glasses that I do have rather than focusing on

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
what I can't do or don't have.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
That's when it ended.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
To talk about can you talk about like the support that you've

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
received.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Oh lots of support from my

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
family my big sister

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Montoya I.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
Mean they have been they have just

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
instrumental in helping me

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
you know we had some you

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
. Know my. Mom. Has

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
difficulties you know. Mouses

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
family stepped in and helped you know

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
with pretty much everything and I mean from get

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
help in the lawn and then need to be

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
encouraged to go on when I have back pain

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
and you know. Whenever I didn't think at all.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Now I was in a college. Oh yeah because

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
you know they have muscle spasms in my back. They're like

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
there was nowhere to come back. Then and just felt

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
slow down because I have less than that's done before and I mean no that

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
didn't make it. I have twin sister. Came and so I

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
mean one day you know you can do this to me because I

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
. Knew you'd see how do you think you know the end

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
cause I'm saying you know basically

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
you were standing.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Why don't you do you know Chata come back because I had been away for a while

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
and hope it works. I mean have they arrive late

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
because when I had gone through all of them that you know

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
the masses came it was like oh you know I'm

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
not going to let you get up you know we have come so far

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
you know you've come so far I'm going to give up.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
And so our family has been an amazing support

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
system really have him.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
It is. Does anyone else in your family have disabilities. Yes

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
I have a cousin who hasn't. I mean he has he's

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
artistic. My grandmother

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
is blown away and

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
so I do have people in our family.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Girl who suffers from harm. He's mentally

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
impaired. So. I have quite a

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
few people. For.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Me.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
This is a day even and

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
stymie a legacy and have me you know able to

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
basically prove that this is wrong and you know conquer their own

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
talent isn't fair I don't you know and I'd be honest

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Brian. Well you know he's doing not

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
go she's doing and I find myself getting down and I think

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
and it gives me encouragement thinking oh

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
they're going to look outside of your family

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
. What kind of support he received.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Oh I see the whatever seem. Like I

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.000
have.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Kids I have. Home. Health care home health

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
thing you know people want to help me with my physical

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
you know and I have.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000
You know.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Needs a tricycle Cherokee not a physical therapy

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
leveling the housing to the daily you know getting

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
just believe me stuff like that and I also have access to

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
physical therapy as well as at

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
the hospital last time I asked

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:35.000
.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
They you know I get a lot of support from them and

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
physical therapy.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
The patient also is very

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
important for me because that helps me and it being he wants to

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
do something as simple as carrying a pocket book. You

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
know and that's really important for quality of life. Hence the

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000
sun Why do you think it is to fill a

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000
normal as possible. You know anybody who can

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000
help you feel normal can

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
be. But I hope when you you know get dressed in the morning

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
or how do you come up with some kind of a handle that you can put

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
on your bag and carrying it is extremely

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
important for him I mean what if

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
it could

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
be like your childhood and

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.000
what it was like for you to go Whoa.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Well it was but it was also fun.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Because I have family members like.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
I had a kind of the whole way because when I was little I did something

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
called a call on the floor because I couldn't

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.000
.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
I couldn't. Use my legs. It's a

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
game day when he would fall on the floor if me to let me leave

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
late. We will play together before the Senate ask you

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Phil included thatis possible to insist we

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
replay what we did do something where we use the play would be way

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
more intimate things that she might not be to our

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
my goals and then down on the floor and then get on the

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
floor with me and call around on the floor and pick up the.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
This is lucky you know we made it out of the gate

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000
when I was able to pick up those pieces and put it in the bucket so

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
as I was this is a much

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
different way and they can bring with them much more

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
insistent and I we would

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
rank she would play a video game. Sometimes it was hard for me to

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
play video games because there came to her home was made in a way

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
I couldn't believe it with my hands so she would

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
play the game.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
I would watch him play in the game and I would say you

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
know how many you know. Only you

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
know a no go to this you know so it was kind of like I was

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000
still playing in the game.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Even though I wasn't physically playing the game.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Do you remember the games they were always playing games on

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Nintendo sixty four. We play for a station

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
games leave a game boy bands I mean you name it we

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
play me replace a Genesis one and laughing

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
. This is saying there you know

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
I don't believe any video game is

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
a time when there is in really did you ever play

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Animal Crossing Claymore Animal Crossing.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
No Oh well like Halo

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
and area act and there was a little bit right that came

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
when I was not so interested in getting someone like

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
that came after more of these you know

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
Where the Grand Theft Auto Grand Theft Auto.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
No no but my family trying to discourage violence

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
as much as possible although we did play Mortal Kombat

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.000
.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Grand Theft Auto wasn't really a game that I have played a whole

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
lot because I think it was just a bit much.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
You know Mario love mail

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
handling fame is my favorite game of on time and it

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
is high which is that's

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
an attendance sixty four but they have it now for

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000
.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
We and so on and I

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
was in a pretty poor.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Man's life past and I think it is

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:02.000
you know if you get home from school play video games

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.000
.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Well my parents.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Allow us to play video games that are

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
like my big sister. You know

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
they didn't really allow me to play video games

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
last we were in the know on Christmas vacation or even

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
finished our homework. We couldn't it was we couldn't come home

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
right away and play video games you know we had to make sure

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
their parents were pretty strict with that and I thank God for that

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
because it helps instill in the work ethic

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
that is in us now.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.000
You know so.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Happy about that time it seemed a

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
little harsh but now that I am back and think about it

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
like they were right.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
You.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Know so so what else are you

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
growing up like for you. Well.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Yes.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Sometimes it was hard because you know I had fun so

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
I didn't always work.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Is everyone else doing you know because well I came

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000
on there you.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Know there were certain hand games day like we used

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
to play like a sister use that way to clean

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000
with hand game that I was home for me because I couldn't turn

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
my face and I. Wish I always wished

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
you know because I was that plane. She wanted to play and

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
I you know we chatted.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
You know we want to adapt. If she were thing I know is that the

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
game you know so that I was

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
You know that was a pretty important part of

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
. You know playing games in

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
my family that you know but it was hard because like

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
I said I had and then. And then my. Last is

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
. To work as well as there has

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
been for many years I wondered why you know

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
and then the stand or how can I look just like her

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000
hair I get the same grades that's going to give everything else that

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
You know you can't like there's just so many.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
I think you know what he's.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Like. No one around in the

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
playground and play you know on the way into it or

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
you know like.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
I couldn't say Frances the pain they had these

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
places where we make

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
the kids will be claimed and you know

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
my family didn't put me you know

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
at this time I just couldn't understand that but you know I

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
was being left now and I don't understand that you know I mean again

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
because again my mind was work in the same way.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
There was one of them I was thinking and just like any other kid and I just

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
physically couldn't do it you know and so that was hard.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Yeah that was hard you know. Yeah.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Oh do you. OK so you

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
focus instead on what you can and that's what I do

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
to you Don't you

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
can easily dig yourself into a whole question

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
of the day they spend so much time

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000
you know being in being upset about what you can do to

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:32.000
save it. I don't half days when I wish I could do

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
this I can just get up and you know when I have

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
no wait for somebody to tell me you know things that most people

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
take for granted

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
. Yes I wish I could do those things but at the same time I

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
realize that there are people who are so much worse than I am.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
They're people who can't even feed themselves they have people who have

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000
feet and can't eat at all there are people who you

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:08.000
know have no feeling below the waist I mean you know

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000
people who are standing

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
. So when I. Can.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Remember those people say Thank You got it released.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
You know. All in goals and do this I mean I would be it wouldn't be

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
able to do this.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
So maybe it will be worse if I couldn't do this all

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
of this land and then well I think last minute can't be

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
sound as I try to count my blessings instead of

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
counting you know the

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
effects this year because

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
You know.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
So. What happened

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
then when I'm growing up growing up and

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
I mean Lincoln had a great chance. You.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Know left that which I meant gloomy as much as anything

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
. I went to the school and I get good grades

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
in high school and you know I graduated from high

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
school and I actually I have the accent doing high school and

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
actually I work very hard when I was high school I

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
was get instruction from teachers and I spent over

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
an hour on pages with tears and

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
rename pain that I had in my pants that me and I

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
graduated only a semester late which I'm pretty proud of

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Any financial Yeah you know because.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:08.000
My high school actually hosted a program where

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
we got to participate in those tours

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
and we got some learn about like the

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
offices of the college you know and

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
so they could be hopeful for you in college

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
where you would be able to get no steak.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And you would be able to.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Have access to a tape recorder in case you think you know

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000
fast enough ahead and time one examines that you know

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
that was really important because.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
I was very nervous about what I don't know I would be able to change

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
into college because I didn't know if any services would

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
be available to me as a person and in the end it

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
and some that was pretty much you know I have the

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
highest score that was pretty much where it was going oh

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
You know well that's helping me to restart you know what would be

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
a good school for me and what services would be available to

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
me want to say the least bit and that was pretty much

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
. Wow You know after a child you

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
know get into and from an early you know high

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
school and college that you know that was a pretty long

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
journey for me it really was I don't know I don't. Bumps in

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:48.000
the road.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Says you're a fan of the family.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Well I would still get the jewelry and I hope

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
that I continue to have it. Just

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
people aren't flying into. Book and

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
surgeries. You get oh OK well not all of

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
us and we release it is in the back of my

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
surgeries I just let my legs you know just

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
been able to move your lungs

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
. Oh yeah.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Some surgeries were somewhat helpful...

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:43.000
um... like, for example, I had surgeries on my ankles to help straighten out

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
my feet more because my muscles would twist my feet around so

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
it helped me to be able to put on, like, shoes

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
and do things that, you know, you or anyone else wouldn't even

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
think about... but I don't

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
know if,

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
I mean some of them were

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
helpful, and I don't want to go into detail about them too much,

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
you know, but others seem like it was just, you know,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
almost like they were just experimenting on me or something, you

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
know, because it didn't really help a whole lot.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
I ended up having to get sometimes double

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
done, like, they would do one surgery and something would happen

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
and they would have to operate on the same area again, you know, years later

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
So... it... it's been a tough road, it really has.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
But God is good, so I'm

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
not complaing, you know, He... He's

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
been good, I'm really happy.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
So where do you -- we didn't go over -- where... where you live

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Where I live?

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
Where exactly? Like the street. I live in East Harlem

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
I live, um, 

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
I live in El Barrio, right near,

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000
um...

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Near 116th Street.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Yeah...

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Is there anything that you would talk about -- touch upon -- that we haven't talked about yet?

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Uh...

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
I think I got a pretty good... um... I

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
covered a lot of areas. I covered school

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
like family stuff

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Do you want to talk - Going to church which was -- which is -- big for

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:08.000
for me... really big for me... mmm, that's

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
pretty much, you know... Do you want to talk about

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
your parents, what they do? Well...

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.000
my -- well my dad passed away,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
my mom is,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000
she has a disability, so she wasn't able to work.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Um... but yeah, I mean that's...

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
I mean they... like I said they didn't work, but um

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
what I can say is that they were very big on education

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
and they always tried to

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
encourage us to, like, do very well in school

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
focus on our books, focus on learning, uh

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
My dad was a huge black history buff, I mean, he taught me a lot

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
about black history and with everything that's going on today

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
uh, you know with the police

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
brutality and

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:19.000
you know all these, sort of, movements, that are

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
going on right now, I-I tend to think about

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
him a lot, you know... and I miss him a lot, you know?

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Especially seeing what's going on around me today

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
even feeling a little scared being, you know,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
African-American and being in this country it just [sighs]...

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
sometimes I wonder if I'm really truly a citizen the way they

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
treat, you know, my people. It-it is scary

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
it really is.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Just got to keep on keeping on I guess. You know, keep

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
fighting and don't let anything get us down, you

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
know? That's all we can do. You can't

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
give up, you can't -- no matter how much

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
opposition there seems to be out their, we can't let it get to us.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
You know, because then what is there if you give up

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.000
you got nothing left.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
So um, we are talking, or you were talking -- About my dad. You're right, your dad, yeah.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Yeah I mean with everything going on,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
um,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
With this... with the police

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
brutality and the things that African-Americans continue to

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
suffer through in this country, I mean, I can't help

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
but think about him because... he

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
always wanted us to know who we were

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.000
and to know our history and know what people went through

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
they're spending today. You know.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
And. Seeing everything is going on you know in

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
vision and

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.000
.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Everything else and then. You.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Know and the government that's one of the things they're really I mean I don't

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
feel bad. I think I should go off.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000
On you know but I

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
mean I you. Know

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
somebody.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Who said you know he just wanted us to know who

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
we want to be brought up and we ran to.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Let anybody make us feel this is because again

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
you know I'm saying in the sea and everything it goes around now

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
it's like back in the nineteen sixties

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:18.000
and you feel like Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa Daddy say ever since he

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:23.000
was not right what his take on this and on

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
the other hand I'm happy day.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
You know he's not around to see this because I think

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
that it would be really.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.000
You think he would be sad to see what words

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
mean scary because I feel like instead of taking a step forward we've taken a step

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
back in this country.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
What.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Do you think this type of stuff has been going on but

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
finally right now we're dealing with it as a country all along.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Yes definitely I think it's been going on on time.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000

patient with me. Any mental

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:53.000

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Nothing to say. She has

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000
no you know she she has been able to

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000
you know make two. Then I am going to do the same

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:12.000
thing. Sprayed it as well.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:17.000
And it was a growing up she did the best she

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
could you know

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000
.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:32.000
There are any words you have from the recording.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Well. I think they.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Who have this list if you. Have time in your life who have you

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000
are I think they have a

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.000
fear like you just can't go on. I want to invite

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000
you to say I'm praying to Jesus curries

00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:00.000

you know. No matter what your circumstances may change

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:15.000
but the Lord will never change and so I think there

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.000

. That is a man who can do

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
you know.

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Well Jane Jane it's a pleasure speaking with you.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000
husband. Yes and who he is how you met him

00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000
. Well.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Spent in school his name is George.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000
And he's been really a great guy.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:17.000
He he also has a very. He

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:22.000
was born with it as well. We met in school

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
and.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000
He is and put his.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000
It's almost like a missing link from the sentencing and they just

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
don't seem like big government

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.000
. He's like oh he's kind of like a clue

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:49.000
to changes in a way. Please Me Like

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:50.000
it's.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Standing upright absolutely backwards he says he's the

00:54:55.000 --> 00:55:00.000
person you can't just me and that's where I'm

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
standing up.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000
And I met we you know I met him in

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000
kindergarten. I haven't even know that he liked me until I was

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000
seventeen years ago and he acts me out of school

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
bus home.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.000
It's like OK you

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:28.000
know I need to know he was going to marry me and it's I want to. He was

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000
crazy and he said.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.000
He basically you know it is you know Prime

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Minister I mean to send it he would write school

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000
and high school.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:52.000
You know we didn't know I graduated we

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:56.000
continue to have to we had some ups and downs in

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:01.000
our relationship just like anybody else.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Ah well I think again our faith

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:11.000
is what has strengthened our relationship and I

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:16.000
think if it wasn't a phase marriages and

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000
you haven't this is the same

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000
thing the same kind of challenges you deal with the same kind of

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:30.000
issue you know. Sometimes you

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.000
can be really tough times. And great

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:40.000
in this kind of have to keep trying but I

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000
think it's nice to be married because it's the nice to have somebody

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.000
so it's time to when you feel like you don't have any men

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.000
He's very shy and. Is more quiet.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Now he started to open up a little bit more on what he's

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.000
always been someone to co-write a guy.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000
I'm a little out go in and you know they get

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:19.000
a B. and things you know

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000
they are sent the tiny plane where Judge is

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:28.000
more content to just sit back in the bag and

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000
.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000
What is the point is that people know I

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:39.000
have cerebral palsy and the you

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000
know blind or whatever you might find

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
yourself up against you have there

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
is always hope for me

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.000
. Anybody get married doesn't matter that you have a

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000
disability. Don't think just because you have in this

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000
case because somebody out already I think I have a plan for

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.000
everybody you know so you know never give

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.000
up even if everyone else around eternal name is going to

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
happen though.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Believe me he is not possible for God he

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000
didn't do any you know.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:30.000
That's pretty much you know.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Really again it's great to have

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:41.000
You know I have to go out and be looking around the place it

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:46.000
be in holy matrimony as opposed to thinking

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Oh no you know it's nice to be able to have their

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.000
commitment and being came with this campaign not to say it

00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:01.000
is not very hard because you know he would have

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.000
you know but. Again a faith you know keeps

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:11.000
manage going you know. But I did

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000
read his Bible and he helps me get home

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.000
up through my marriage and you know printing let me

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:26.000
spank them a fair I mean. There have been times where it's

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.000
just it's just been so hard and I think been in

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000
situations where I just wouldn't be able to
