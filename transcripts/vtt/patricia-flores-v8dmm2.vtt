00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[LW] It's May 1st, 2015.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is Lynn Winterreise interviewing Patricia Flores. So

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
please, uh, tell me a little bit about yourself in your life before

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
your disability. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
[PF] Born in ?Birdseye, California, um, to

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
lower-middle class parents and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
very hardworking parents, very hardworking family

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and um, uh, parents that

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
wanted me to do whatever it was happy.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So, you know they weren't the kind of parents that wanted me to

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
be either you know either, you know a lawyer, or a doctor or an MBA

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
they wanted to go out there and do, you know whatever it was that

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 So, um, when I was in high school I found

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
out what that was and that was art and art history so

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Um, when I told them that they were like, "Oh, that's fine."

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So, that's what I ended up doing. I ended up

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
going to community college first and then transferring to UC Santa Barbara

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
back in the early 90's, oh my God. I think I just dated myself

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and got a double BA in Art History and Art Studio

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and then eventually after about a three year

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Gap, went on to what ended up being my first

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
?indistinct which brought me here to first time around. [interviewer] What year?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That was in 1998. Uh, no 1997, sorry.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
yeah, '97 um and

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Uh, I had gotten into the Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Arts Designer and Material Culture which is in the Upper West Side.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And at that time they were only owned one town-house. And, I think now they own like 3 or 4 on that block

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
[laughter] [cross-talk] so

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
we moved, my husband and I at the time, moved out here

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
here.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We were very excited because he was an artist so

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
you know he was very excited about. Coming out here as well

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Um, and actually when we were out here we were

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
out here for about 7 years so, um

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
during this time we were out here, he ended up going to Colombia to get his MFA.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
which he never planned on doing

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
but, figured while he was here, he might as well do it

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So, I was going to school and after my first

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
semester a job opportunity came up at the Metropolitan Museum of Art

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
which I

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Which I got. Which is in the department European Sculpture and Decorative

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Arts. As their collections management

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
assistant at the time and then later on I became one of their coordinators

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
was to begin digitizing all of their

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
object records collection, er catalog.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Basically begin putting all that information onto

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the web for the first time

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
for them they were basically one of the last of the big museums in the country to do it

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
it at that time so it was a pretty big undertaking.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Was only supposed to be a 2 year project and I ended up

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
on that project for six years. And it was still going on when I left, so.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
It was a pretty amazing opportunity to be there for 6 years and

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
be able to work with the curators and to be able to work with the objects.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Yeah. It was really great. And I ended up

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
working with one of the curators in the department on my thesis

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
at the time as well. I was working on these other ?tapestries

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
. That were. England's.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Tongue people. Who's not a director. Yeah yeah so

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
that was pretty special. Actually. Well

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
. OK thing is just fine. So

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and so similar. To those on one

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
. Hand I was actually at work. That

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
morning. And I get a phone call. From. My husband

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
. And his office is only a few blocks away. From.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
The World Trade Center. So he called me you know he was one

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
of the chief of the. Museum

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
. Right around the.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Clock. Said it was him online

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
. Getting a call from a carrier for Germany

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000
They're saying. Who is watching it

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and so that was our first indication that something was terribly wrong

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
. Today.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
You know that there are two people called the same thing.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
But you know people are starting to get worried because of the fact that they knew that

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
someone. In the department. Had someone

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Down. There and write ups in time

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
as well. The chairperson. Of art

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
. Department director who had just gotten.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
There. Just got back.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
From going.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
From. There basically saying get out

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
. Yeah basically said you know. So it's like

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
. Terrorism. They called. The target.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
That. Building. And so they were working

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
. Theory. All the. Guests first

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
. And you know they object

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
. Yes. You know. It's. Just.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Metairie. And. Then they just sort. Of

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
insecurity. You. Go. To start. Out. Without.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Thinking.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And we were. In them

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And. Because we had to go through a number. And

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
start a sighting. OK do.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
You

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000
.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Know Why I mean in case of somebody coming in

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
case anything were to happen to the vein.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Everything. Extreme violence here in town.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
God.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
You know done stories. Safer right

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
. So

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
. You know I couldn't think straight

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
. OK thank. You. You.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
See. He had told me that he had watched

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
the stock. Market. And he

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
was sitting there watching people. And.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
That. Was the last thing. You know I was

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
that end of the study here for the day

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
. Because another round. And

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
. Great. Sorrow

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000
. You know. I'm making the

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
decision. After.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
That and after they had to say to him that I would actually

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
. Can.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Tell my plus

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
you know foreigners and historically and and they get stuck on the trains

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
in my car.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So. So basically. You. Know

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
When. You get

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
. There. Trying to. Dismantle.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
It. And of course once you hit fourteen that's been hit

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
. Very. High scrutiny

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
. Of the times. Now

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
What. They.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Tell me. Like it seems people can and.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Testament. To. You

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
. And. You know

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
. Finally I. Start walking. Toward. The

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Hudson. And by.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
The way. And

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Sterling.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
You know of course you got the worse it was

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
. But that's also you know his. Officers

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
. More toward. The river as well so

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I was just like.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
On. So just. Walking

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
. Around. Walking running walking and walking around

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and you know the clergy.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
You know they were suddenly like. To us.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And. Everything's heard and because by then by now they

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
had already gone. And. I

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
didn't. Understand that. I didn't know. At all.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
If. You didn't register You were people walking out

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
. You know covered.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Just

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Say they were fire.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Back. But all of this is weird. It just doesn't make any

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
sense. And. I

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
finally made it to his building his office building

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
. And by then there was nobody there. Dylan is

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
closed today.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And I'm. OK she is.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And. By then I was so completely disoriented

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
. Because everything was just covered in signficance evening

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
. And so when you're walking

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
in. Or. Broadway

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
. Teams only really.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Forty six was. Really close

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
. And. I could not

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
understand it although until I got. Close

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and then I. Thought. I finally looked at

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.000
. Captain India. And we're

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
all down on the ground. Doesn't

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
caper. Is so completely

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
in shock I couldn't understand that. All I know

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
is that I haven't been here.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And. I looked up. And

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
. Went in the world

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
. You know and I finally stopped it was like what what

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
happened. They're gone. They fell down

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
. Yeah. No.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Way. And I

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
did not know. Where. He could be.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So I just kept walking. Going.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:08.000
On

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And then I remember. That. Hour.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Later

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And you know seeing wasn't on

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
The ground. Now. Who knows I mean where are you

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.000
now

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:40.000
.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And. We. Don't

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Think literally pastor. With. That

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
. Same. Or.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Christian Identity. For him to do

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
is. Talk of it too. It's like.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
It was. A really well conduit

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
if well pasturing in which is actually

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:17.000
where they crossed.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
It's turned into like a

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Little. One

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
. I'm just so you know

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
decided OK you know maybe they're related. I mean this Congress

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
. So. I decided. To

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Turn. In that direction. I was

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
hurt. By this because it was just an ear

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
. And I mean so it's taking everything

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
. From. The time I got home that night

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I say. Because that is it

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
. Was it was just a minor. Problem

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And. I wasn't that far

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
away from it.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
So I. Don't understand how I know

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
. How much.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Wiser this time have elapsed during the day. All I

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
know is that it

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
By the time it was close to him

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
it was. For. You

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
. And

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
not in any sense of timing.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
At all. Again the

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
building two already broke down.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And worked with volatile or. Yes. Or

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
. No it

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.000
. Was Actually I

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
think most of these cameras caught it.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
On. Day.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
One. But I was actually quite close to

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
the. Notice was enormous

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And. It's like I started

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
hearing him I hear it

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
But I didn't really think about Michael.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And. So

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I. Was correct. In that

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
life. He was frantic. Yeah. Yeah. I was that.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
You know. I.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Mean he's he's pretty easy to

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Figure out. Because. He's he's pretty

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
predictable. And. You know I.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Mean. It was funny because. Well it's funny

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
how the plan. You know.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
When I saw two sentences.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Leave. Him. You know because it was innocent civilians like the trio

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.000
right

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
. Right spot and I was trying to get through there.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
To get across the street. And I was but and I say

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
. The State. Department. And

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
the red. Cross.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
You were only sixteen when you began

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
just cussing at them and.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Finally left one of the. One of the main street

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
. In this great building. And. You

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
. Ran up the stairs and. Only.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
One. Thing

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
. From. Them like. Trash cans

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
is art and there. Is like

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
. A relief in a group of. Well

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
You know what when I actually walked in and saw him sitting. Back

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
. Down.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
So. You know. Me and I knew they had seen. Quite a

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
bit. Ago.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And I get you know when he saw. Me. I'm going to

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
. Miss this place. So

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
. This match is like

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000
.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000
You know I didn't know how he was doing you physically.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Injured. And he was

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
with a talking. Something

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
and I wasn't there and I didn't.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Know. So

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Yeah. And Burton being.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
There in the muck for so long.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Which is what they've been talking about for the last thirty or forty

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
. Years.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
So when when did you start to realize it's

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Probably four months later. Really. Yeah. You know I mean I still

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
have that ring in here every day.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Yeah. But then. I have been

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
. Working on and trying to get. My. Thesis

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
. Of. Him. And. You know.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Actually. Partnering. With my.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
With my visor one day and I'm seeing him and I

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
have been kind of dizzy. And. It was really

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
exciting never felt anything like that before. And by the

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
time I have made it to his office I was actually running in the

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
stuff. That's been locked in a straight line

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
. And he's like Are you OK. Because

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
I ran into the doorway and then I ran to his parents because

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
He's like.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
You know you might you know not really

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000
just for the past two days.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
And I haven't see. My doctor tomorrow

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Right. So so I went to the doctor

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
. With donors with

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
possibly an inner ear infection. And was

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Dana's Berga. Which I. Never. Had before. I

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
. Had never experienced. Before.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
And. You know it's like well you just keep an eye on it and it gets worse

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
. You know.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Really. Man I was

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Back in his office two days later. It's worth

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
to the point where you can

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
. And.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Say. OK We're going to probably hear ya

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
You know and of course let me remind you of my here too

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000
.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
And so. You know he

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
started a string of referrals to.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Specialists. Which went on for a.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Year. He did you precisely make that connection to

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
be down there with the with the big noise right

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
away.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Right where.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
I can make and I didn't make a connection with them in ways I mean more of a connection with. Dust

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
. Time. You know. Down there. Was

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
. A.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Long one you know. We really don't know.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
I'm just surprised you know.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
You are. You know I'm here and it. Was

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
missing a lot of work.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
And. That wasn't going very well. You know

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
I can't. Turn. It. Over.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Winter. And.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
You. Know. It. Isn't willing. Or. Able.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
And. You're hearing the breaking point you

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Know this was OK. Right. Away. At that

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
. Least as far as I knew

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
. At the time. It. Wasn't

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
. Just. Later. OK

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
. So so here

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
I am me stumble upon. My. Poor

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
. Back. And say. OK.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
I know what you're dealing with a person reading my. Own.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
And to rest

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000
.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
For a circular. Build So basically he was telling me

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
. Something that there was like an engine to my system

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000
. So they sent me to the

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
three little canals that are here. That

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
maintain your bounce. On. And

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
. That really all it has done is. Physical

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
. Like.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Really. So yeah

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
So I ended up there for two years

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Back and forth and patience.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Yeah. Go into rehab and psychological.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
And the physical rehab. No it's actually really

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
interesting stuff. They basically work with your balance your

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
coronation.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Here had a. Great mission

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
. And basically have to do a lot of like

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
walking exercising that is currently doing

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
. Their own things like walking

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
and walking up and down stairs. On the. Treadmill

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
which to this day I still cannot do.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
I do learn to. Get on

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:23.000
the. Exercise bike. Without getting sick.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:28.000
For. A few years ago. But I haven't actually been on. A.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Bike. For many years. And

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
. I'm.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Here. And still. You know. Two

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
cars in the backseat. Fancy

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
. Pants and. Busses are still

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
really are busy. Planes are really aren't the same

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
. An amenity the only thing I can do is trains.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Which is strange. But they said no. It's not strange

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
. You know. Quite a few people do

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
. Treat me

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
. Well

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Anche really the best way to deal with Vertigo is. Walking

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
. Walking is your natural calibrator just

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
. Walking you do. More.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Once controlled. So I did and so on just to

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
keep it will be critiqued Philip to all these years.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
So. Yeah. It's always going to be there. And the

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
tonight is to night is still there. So you know I'm going to have. You

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000
know. I still hear rain. So are you going to can

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
both eras. Yeah yeah so so

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
basically here I started noticing the here and going in two

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
thousand and eight.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
So it took me seven years but.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Most of the archaeologists that I've seen told me

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
that it was probably starting to go from day one. That just a very

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
slow rate. And then over the years it

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
. And it had started

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
going just and right here that's where most of the

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
really big screen. And so what I was

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
hearing. At the end of. It

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
. And. I

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
noticed it. When. I started. When. I was. Down

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
here. I was working at the time for an

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
article. Their. Own. Band

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
. Program. Manager. And. Was teaching.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000
At night. And.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
I've noticed. That being at a big lecture all I can. Hear

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000
. My students. And so. I. Decided to go get it checked out

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
. The. Past

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
. Year or. So and. So I was like

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:27.000
.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Oh. You didn't get it right away. Yes. I know it is OK

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000
to

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
. Do this

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
so you were able to really. Big knowledge what was happening and not

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
going to go away.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Yeah I think it was just because I let it right there with Ergo I was like OK this

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
. Is normal. This is coming towards me

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
so. I was really scared

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
. But at the same time I was like yeah. You know I mean.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
I. Can't teach if I can hear. You need to figure out what's going

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
on. So. I just. Go.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
We don't know we don't know what's going on. But. We're talking about a loss

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
to. Figure out what's.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Going on the kind of three Richard has been very supportive family in general you can

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
see my family where.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
They don't understand what's going on I'm scared. And rightly

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
so. My

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
. Current theory that. Time.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Is. Going. To. Claim. It is in

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
use. And I wasn't there

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
As a whole. Which is wrong. So

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
. Yes.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Literally. With Tommy I don't know.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000
They're. Actually trying

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
to come to my They're my parents. And you

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
sit there and tell my therapist and Myspace I don't believe in there and

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
you just sit there and. You know.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
And. And.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
It was hilarious.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
That's. Your kind of. Knew. It was going to be over

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
And you're also dealing with this here in the US well

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
On. This

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
. C two

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
thousand and twelve. Their

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
boss. Bent. Oh

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
. Yeah two thousand and twelve

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
. So

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
. And that it was going. Quickly

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
. At that time. Three My

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
doctors at once. Because.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
You know. They didn't like what they saw. Right

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
so they. Can. Sense

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:49.000
.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
When you're listening to yours. And what you mean when you state

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
For both ears. And it's going fast

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
. Yeah this might have

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:07.000
been. A network

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
. Talk to keep work

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
. And

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
. You know it's tough enough when you

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
. Are not getting full support. Around. Here. It's been

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
. Tougher line. OK for support from

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
. Letters. So.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
I had lost my job looking article. On

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000
. The big house at my house. Marks

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
. That I. Bought for me. In the H.R.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
office and front page or picture. As the architecture

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
of.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
The City. Now what are you kidding me. Places illegal

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000
. Really. Yeah.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
And then as I left home and got an attorney. And

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
yeah. I am but I couldn't keep it going. Business

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
and Planetary Sciences go go for five hundred dollars an hour

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
I just lost my job.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Where I learnt all the cases though

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
. I do. Not like the

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
rule irony. Of it all. It's like you know most. Of

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
the. Time. You know attorneys will continue until Jesus

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
I'll. Get them. Back. You know it isn't the other way around

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
or to paint on.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
They actually win the case

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Yeah so that particular. Case

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
. I mean. Because.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
So. I hear.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
All of them. So you were working

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
I was unemployed for a little. While

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
able to get more teaching so I was teaching or full time for about a

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
year.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
And then. I was getting really

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
stressed out. From both of teaching and just

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
. You know stress or

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
. You know losing a job

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
not having health insurance.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
And you know the whole the whole thing I mean to have to cover yourself. For

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
health insurance in California and fire thousand dollars

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
a month. Well

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.000
. Yeah. And I was just an adjunct

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
. Professor.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
You know making. For over two

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Years. So

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
. You know.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
When it's a slave. And you had to move back to

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
California in which year two thousand and four

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
I was laid off. From the article. And.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Didn't.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Mean. It doesn't mean the crisis

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
. Right now and you know

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
This is right at the time that I started losing. So you know I was going

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
through. You know those various images of

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
. Disabled people go OK.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Because. Without. Them. Knowing

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
. You know when you get to a certain point

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
where. I just can't anymore. I got a

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
point where I couldn't because like you know. One thing

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
. I ended up losing. Our

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
because I can no longer.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Even with a hearing aid.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Yeah I hear you need a really terrible when it comes to. Guns

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
. And especially if they don't have the right equipment

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
. We have a telephone. Line. But

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
. You know what they.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Call digital tolling systems

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:04.000
. Or. Didn't. Do. Anything

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
. It didn't matter at all. So

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Any improvement in our past so

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000
that septic own us. Space discoveries are

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000
just completely. Wrong

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
And it was worthless. It's not here

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
. And it just straight out tell

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
. Me What we need and I thought

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
. It was scary. Town finds that

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
. Later. They lay

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
off a bunch of people. One.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Again if the same. Question

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
. What do you do

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
on the last job I lost. Because I was

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
like right after. I was going to. Sell

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000
.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
You a note and I decided to go back to school

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
. Because you know I

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
have lasts five years has

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
. Been. Employed for.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Quite

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000
.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
A while. When

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
. We. Bring.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000
It back to. You know.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Yes QUESTION How it stresses making crazy

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
so I can't. Do this anymore. And

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
. Here. Is basically running away.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
I had just gone through a fire study a Stanford

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
University. System they were doing

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
. A year. Hospital

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
. Where I was very

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
lucky to get.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Prolonged. Exposure

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
therapy is you have to

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
go in and continuously tell the story

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
. Over. And. Over. And over.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
There are. Attempts to do is move those

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
memories from one part of your brain to the other. So that you no longer have

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
. The flashbacks panic attacks. And

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
. Mirrors. It basically removes it from the

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
part of the brain that looks at it as a

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
. As a

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
structure. Or as a you know. Form. Of.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Fish or. You know pain

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
. And instead

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
you.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Know and you know it isn't received at

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
. Rome. With those memories and

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000
. So. On. It's actually pretty

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.000
.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Old. It's a pretty old modality

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
. But that. They were

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Looking. Pretty extensively. Again.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
It's. A mentality. For. Returning soldiers

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
. I. Guess. But they also wanted to

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:03.000
bring in. Another. Another. State where

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:07.000
you know. There were other cases

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
. That. It.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Took. And that was helpful for you.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Extremely. Extremely angry. It took away the bus that

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
took away the panic attacks mostly. It didn't take away the

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
nightmares. I still have nightmares. But to this

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
day to this day I suddenly thought. You know it's not

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000
. Universal. But it.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
I mean I can live with my. Sons I don't have the flashbacks anymore.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
That's why I lost.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Because in the classroom. Well I was

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
in. A. Part. Around

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:59.000
. Wasn't you.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Know. Going from one community college to another

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Private. School in Cisco and

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
We were stopped in Oakland. Pretty big

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000
transfer. Stuff. In conversation

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
. We were stopped at quite a

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
while so I called them to let them know they. Are public.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Or.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.000
In my ear or minutes late. You know the director's like a problem.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
I'm. Literally like your children

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
. Are. Trying to. Play with.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Please. Break their

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
. Machine and dogs

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
and you know they were trying to. Clean up

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000
. From Dr Gray.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Really close and they want to make sure that they're

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
well they get on the train

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
all the trains that were in the changing world started it all worth it

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
and you know because of all those years after nine eleven and

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
. All. The. Cars and all. The

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
. National Guard. Are all. Over. In

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
the.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
American subways and streets live in. Tokyo.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Right so when they're. Down. Which is

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
pretty normal. For me. I mean if something. Happened I was. Not

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Always say.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
A military base but. Someone. Else

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
. Can be. And. Why

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
. Every

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:20.000
.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Time. One of them are coming to town. Every

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
October. And. Saying. I can't do you know

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:34.000
.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000
So. By the time I go

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
. To school. I

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
mean. You know I haven't quite. Gone down yet. Walked into

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
the classroom and she looked at me and she's like. You

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
. Like. It will be

00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:01.000
.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
And you. Know I. Mean

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
. I. Called Senator. Golden.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Yes. With no explanation. Oh yeah. Student

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000
your health at. All. And

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
told me years ago. Suck it up

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:35.000
. Yes. And I was in the presence of the

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
staff psychologist. And. We're all

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:44.000
. Kitty and just sitting there she's like

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
. Oh my God I. Just said that

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
look you know I. Couldn't take the

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
cake. They are.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000
There. And any of the fun.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Then when true victims of nine eleven think that any of those one

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
thousand you never because I could never prove that I was younger

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
I didn't work. Through. That. I have

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.000
and. I try to show them

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
his business card which showed it to us. Because I

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
couldn't stand that. Day. I hate it

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:40.000
. And because it was so many years later. When

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Einstein. Popped up. I was. A

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
. Direct. Correlation

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
. So. Yeah

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
. Thank

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
God for. So to this day. So

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
. I've had to stop. Talking

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
or virgins. Contributor insurance because I

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000
just said.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Intuitive thing. When did this begin you mean. Because to

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000
create existing It wouldn't be covered.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000
I could have a look at it proper existing

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
but if I try to. Connect it anyway and

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
. So

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
. On. Then

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000
. That's been hard. Because they

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
are all you know more. Than

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000
.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000
One.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Cell.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Until then you know what made you decide to be so you were being

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.000
treated in San Francisco for everything and that's where they discovered

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
I was being.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Treated there eight years. Or.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000
So and then what made you decide to come back east. Yes

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
yes. You. Know I. Couldn't. Sleep.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Yeah it. Was my husband.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.000
And I have a very lucrative. Career position. And

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000
I. Have been trying to decide. If. I was.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Especially after. Sounds

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000
. Hears. Her. And

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000
. You know I have been

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
thinking.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
About going into disability

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:13.000
. Because I've gotten

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
very interested. In the air

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000
.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Traffic. Yeah just based on my own experience and you particularly with the you know

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
employment discrimination that was the

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000
first.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Notch I think for me because I was just such a huge presence in my life

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000
And so I actually did think

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000
. It

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
was.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.000
It was actually in college. And

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.000
. There was actually a

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:06.000
couple weeks before the end of it. Yeah. Yeah. I

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
actually. Ended up being. Of

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
the really. Big. Words. OK

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.000
. And then when I got back to Oklahoma.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:25.000
On Oh I should have loved. Back here helping all my

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:25.000
friends

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000
. It was kind of one of those situations

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Because I still have a lot of friends here. And we. Live

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.000
. Downtown. Manhattan

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:44.000
. And actually one of the women I stayed with us too it's a

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.000
good.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Thing. She would be just a little village.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.000
For. Me. Yeah that

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Berkman for her but it still

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.000
. Didn't make it easier for so. Long

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:13.000
. You. Really Want. To be here. To help

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
. But

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000
. Going back to

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000
. The unification state then you're

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.000
. Like OK this is a sign

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000
. Telling me to. Make a change

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:38.000
. That's. All.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000
It's an issue and never ask them for money. And they just

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000
happened. A little.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Bit. And they and they weren't.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Always part of.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000
It. But it was decided to because I think that here

00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000
.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:04.000
You go if you're a talk. By. The woman whose

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000
. Thesis advisor. And he was marvellous. She's

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
an assistant professor.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Teaching disability studies are

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:20.000
. Funded

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.000
.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000
The project right now I'm talking books. So might looking around at all

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.000
equipment and all of us. Fell

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000
On. Her when her research assistants for that. Project are now

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:39.000
. On. The

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000
. Issues of the. Paper. And

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.000
. I call them

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000
. An ass to. The public.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000
And. You know they ask you to look at something

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000
. And so.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000
And. So forth.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:09.000
So I. Met. Her. In. That department while

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000
it was here. And.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:16.000
I. Decided why it was actually going to only

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:20.000
apply to this day. When I. Got. There I could only go on

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000
knowing that I didn't want to go

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000
.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:32.000
So. I applied to this. One

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000
program. You're constantly gauging. You

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:43.000
And in the meantime have any plans to do about me and living

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000
with my cousin and his wife. So while

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000
I was waiting to hear about them anyway. If I had of the apartment.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000
And. You know just about ready to leave. And

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:00.000
. Then I got the email.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Resolutions. And that was like two days before I left. And received a

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.000
scholarship I got some funny. Yes.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000
And I continue to get funny.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Here and you know that's actually a master's program.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.000
When you get into the country.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
So you can

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:33.000
see. You know the whole time I've been here I

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:38.000
mean it's just been very weird I mean to me. That I

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:43.000
made the right. I mean

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000
everybody here has been extremely supportive. You know

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:53.000
I recently had to. Make that really hard decision

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.000
to put up. My graduation for another term. Which was

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:03.000
. That was a hard. Decision. But I also

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:08.000
had to think about my own. House. And I hope this

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.000
. Question. Hasn't been. Since. OK

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000
. So. You know I've had a couple of

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000
big scares Well I've been here. Really

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:27.000
. Well I mean here. Was

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:30.000
their. Hand.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.000
I have it return. Really

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000
stubborn diversion business here which is basically

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.000
forced me into this project

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
. But this doesn't mean

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.000
. You know it's

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:57.000
basically since

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:02.000
. You

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:07.000
. Know. And so

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.000
you know you have. To. Just let it

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:17.000
go. At least that

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.000
used to really be fixed. Yeah. You know

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.000
now to. The point where. I. Can't. I can't fight you

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
. I have to just let you go

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.000
. And.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Just you know plain brown. And then I can continue

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000
working.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Any tree leading to what she saw. Oh yes what happened

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
to us both.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000
I saw his body parts on the ground. Near

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000
.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:01.000
As I

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000
. Can

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
. Never. Really. Get.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Those. Yeah

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.000
I said thinking sounds yet. To turn on

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000
.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000
You know. As I can see a

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000
therapist pleasantly.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.000
Didn't. Seem to be.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000
And so you have hearing aids nearly as you know have hearing aids

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.000
.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000
I am you know categorized a profoundly hard hearing

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.000
. Which doesn't mean you're totally totally

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000
tough but pretty close to

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000
take these out. I can't hear much.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.000
When I have. A man I. Hear. OK

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000
It means I haven't started losing clarity yet

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.000
but the last time I have it here and asked their

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000
.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.000
Allergists to notice they're starting to lose that.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000
The first time. The clarity of the sound clarity it sounds particularly clarity of

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000
words. And that's not a good sign

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.000
. Actually section without sign. Because the work they are doing

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000
that you lose a lot of activity here and are

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:46.000
. Yet. And the more you want to start you know.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:51.000
OK Do you want. To. Have a good

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:56.000
I have thought about it and. There is

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.000
one real risk. And one of the things that

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000
popped up. When he did. Writes the CAT scans a few years

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
ago it was. My carotid. Artery

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
. Runs too close to my inner ear.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
You know it's one of those logical

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Things. That you know you would never see.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Which are. Wrong. And. You know

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:35.000
unfortunately you know to. Start cutting things they'll start

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
shoving wiring in there.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
So close to your car. It isn't it that's

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000
all.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
So you might have to prepare myself for.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:55.000
This. You know I've already started on his language.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Happy. I. Think I'm. Trying to keep up with

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
causes which is here.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000
And he is. Very ill.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000
And this really wonderful little place

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
. Yeah it's like this.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:22.000
On it's like this little converted studio apartment it is so

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000
wonderful and they have it you look at such an offer to like these pieces

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
. And. You know they hold. Classes.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
You know it's like it's quiet in there. You can have three fastest growing and there

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.000
.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.000
You know you.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Know. Oh are you talking

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.000
. And the guy that

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
wanted to. Be

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000
. A. Place. Where

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000
. You know I haven't. Been able

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:05.000
to keep up with my classes this last Are they enough me to Texan

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000
. I'm actually able. To make great to

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.000
have that kind of support. Yes yes. You know we really care about.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
History. And. Culture

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.000
.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.000
No I. Mean it's. It's. Really. I mean. I have

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
a tutor you know and I had started

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000
. Their. Sister

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
. Her her sister

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Puerto. Actually teaches at a.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:46.000
School.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Now it's Kentucky

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.000
. And

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000
. She says she saw and heard it

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000
.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.000
It's such a beautiful language today and. That's

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
why. I do.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.000
You know attempted You know because I have to learn German French because of her

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.000
history. But you know I never easy

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
. But something which I find very easy to pick out just

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
because it's such a bore. All right

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.000
. I'm very visual. Artist Chris

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000
. So that. Makes. It.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Easy to pick up which is good because I struggle with the other two

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.000
German in the different branches of it. Yeah

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:58.000
. You know when I was brands like you know. It was the most

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.000
horrible American trying to. Speak French.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:10.000
So now they've got to say I mean what they're doing for you know it's all

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
that they can do all they can do.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000
You know that I will most likely to.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Go. And you go on a regular basis for check

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:22.000
ups

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
. You know at this point I go in when I change

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:31.000
. So we're all kind of at that point now.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Where you know I'm not expecting. That's not going to get back to

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
. You know my artist knows that you know

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000
. That means. OK

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
. So why don't you

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.000
. Give. Us. The.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Results. And is there a rhythm that I mean is it

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:00.000
if you don't want to do it for a while

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Literally every. Fourth.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Back. For a. Little while. So it so

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.000
. That's good news is. It's very

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000
. Tense

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
. Good question. And

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Sin ain't broke don't fix it

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
. Exactly exactly.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
She told me it might hurt for a while and then it. Might start. Sat

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
. And talked. Fine. You know. That happens.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:46.000
But because I bombed out so I asked. You know. It's

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:46.000
.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Not surprising

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
. What do

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:57.000
you mean when you see and get to the bottom of the Arctic ground.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Right now and I said at the very bottom. So when you

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
actually look at my over right now. Rather. Than one

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000
. There isn't. One of.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Them. And then

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:19.000
that would mean it would. Get finished. And

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.000
that would preclude any here in the region

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
. Most likely.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.000
So. How are you feeling about that.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
I'm not going to. Get

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.000
. Her

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Away.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Really then. Trying to be comfortable

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.000
. With what is

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000
. A lot

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
of the work. I've done. A.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Lot. I mean there's so

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
much there's so much more than just. Physical

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
. Yes So much of this is mental.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:24.000
As well. I think a lot of the work for

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
. Me. Of this. And also

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000
just getting on my own. And caring way. So I

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Should.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Say it was becoming a very. Helpful

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000
. Relationship. I mean you know I

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:55.000
thought. He was a really wonderful

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
twenty or. Twenty two. Year

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
. Seventeen years married. Years. Ago

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Sometimes those things come to

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
. Twenty years is

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
longer than many marriages

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:20.000
.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Don't.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Like experiences. It's something you learn. Yeah I

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:31.000
mean you're doing damage Mark. Is. This a.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Talent.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000
It's like. I was in the statistic just like.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Thousands of others. Still

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:44.000
. Remain.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
All. Knowing. That. I've been able. To. Turn things around

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000
. And. Acknowledge

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
. My. Life. And

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000
. Want to

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:05.000
. Do something that. Makes them. Better

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
. And that educates.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Lies. And he just you know

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000
all the discrimination. I. Went through. All those years

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:24.000
.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Hoping. To do. I don't want anybody

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
else. Going.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
It's not necessary my life is very old very

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
successful. You know the. Past that

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
I am

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000
.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Was it. Thought very highly of me and told

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Her. That she looked at me again and

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:04.000
. Be interested

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000
in. The age of eighteen. And

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000
. I say as much as

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000
the static I wanted to stay because I love my

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:19.000
job.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Then. She didn't see any significant

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.000
not. Really.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
But it is. Uncomfortable difficult

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
And you know she.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Makes an example for me every day. So

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:53.000
you will. Get out there. That you. Think you know

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000
because I'm the same person. Rather than the table or

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000
. On. Just one

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.000
. They're. Pretty surprising that people would have that reaction to

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
slug people.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:13.000
I. Mean same charter school. But no you were not

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000
there. But no I don't have to suck

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
it up. Because I happen to be.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
So anything else you want to say that you haven't seen

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Today.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.000
You know I. Wasn't just

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000
. Talking about this it was also. A.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Couple in the anthropology department there were also.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Disability specialists in Iraq

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.000
. Everyone. In this

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000
area. And. I. Think.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000
They and they're both parents are. Disabled children. So I

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.000
think it is. Daughter was. In

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000
. Here. One day. So I'll. Sit

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000
here as well. To. Talk about my story

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:31.000
But. I want to be on the other side hearing it it's a big honor

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:35.000
you know so that. You know what they say that you know

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:40.000
. Life gives you lemons you make lemonade to see you

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.000
take this you know really. Very difficult experience

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:50.000
and and get on top of other difficult experiences at the same time and be

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.000
able to say I want to create the most value not just for

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000
yourself but for other people. Yeah. So it's seen

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
as. You. Know.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.000
People

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:13.000
.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Want it you know that makes you very unusual that one could just

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000
start to feel, it's me, I'm

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.000
just, woe is me. But to have a heart that
