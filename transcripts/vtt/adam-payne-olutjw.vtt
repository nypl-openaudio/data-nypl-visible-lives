00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello my name is Monica Diaz and I'm going to have a

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
conversation with Adam Payne. ADAM PAYNE: Hi. MONICA DIAZ: Hello, for visible lives,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
an Oral History Project at the New York Public Library it is

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is February eighteenth two thousand fifteen and this is being recorded at the

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the Inwood Public Library in New York. ADAM: It is. MONICA: Thank you so

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
so much

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Adam. You know can we, can we start off by having you

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Tell me a little bit about yourself.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Well, my name's Adam Payne, um

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I was born a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
actually I was born in 1971 in Cambridge, Mass.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Jersey. And now I live in New York.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And about two and a half years ago I started to rock climb,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Which

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
? now.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And I'm good. I've won the ABS Nationals

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
twice in my division. So I've got two gold there.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and last year I won

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Paraclimbing nationals in Atlanta. I won the bronze

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
bronze there. Which qualified me to go to Spain to the world's

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
in September, which i did.  I didn't win anything there

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
but that's OK. It was fun anyway. MONICA: You went to Spain. ADAM: I went to Spain.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Spain. Paid for it, but I went there. MONICA: That's great.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And what, what got you interested in

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
in...in

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
In rock climbing? Well, let's see, I

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Well in two thousand and twelve I was an active cyclist.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And I was looking to uh, maybe do a cross-country bike trip

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
but I was thinking that with my disability, I really didn't want to set up a 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
tent every night. So I was going to get

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
"busy sack".  You know what a "busy sack" is? [Monica: No]

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
kind of a bag that you put over your sleeping bag to protect the thing that directly on the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
ground and it gives it waterproof-ness. - Hmm, okay. - So it's like a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
one man tent. And um

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I thought where do you get the bivy sack?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
EMS sprung to mind, so i went to EMS and they didnt have one.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but, they introduced me to one of their sales people

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
also disabled. Karima Bat MONICA:Karima? ADAM: Bat MONICA: Mm

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
who has one leg -- she's a wonderful person! And ah

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
she talked to me about

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
in March and it was now June and ah

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
we talked a bit about that program about what they were doing

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
found out that I would like to go to this program so she invited me

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
but I went - I started climbing with her in July and I've been hooked and

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I climb 2 times a week -- 3 times if I'm training

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
for a competition. [Monica--"that's great, and"

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So you've been doing this about...? Two and a half years - Two and a half years

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Now

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
32 months.  [Monica, "How was it to start?"

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Oh

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Oh I had climbed before. [Monica, Okay.] - Not really well.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
'cause when I was a kid

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I was in New Jersey and I worked for a place called Campmar (?)

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Worked in a place called Capmar.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And at the Capmar I was the director of a sporting good store

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
it was a great place to work I loved it because I was a ? at the time

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
um

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
They had a connection to a local climbing gym. This was in 1994

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
so there weren't very many local climbing gyms.  They were just getting started

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
this was a pretty bad climbing gym.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I loved it and, I started climbing there and I climbed for a

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
a couple months there.  And I improved very little

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Didn't know what I was doing. A lot of it by 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
but that was about it. And then my climbing partner

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
stopped coming so I stopped climbing. And then I

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and then i went on to another job and then i got diagnosed with [inaxia?]

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And I really thought that my

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
climbing days were over. Didn't really care 'cause my climbing days didn't

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
had started.  I climbed twice after 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I got

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
ataxia - I diagnosed, I'd had it all my life.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And ah, so then I

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
when I met Kareemah and started climbing at Brooklyn Boulders

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I was very quickly able to start up at the level I'd left off at

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
five-six, now I'm at a five-nine, five-ten level.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Which is pretty good and

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I've been sponsored by a major manufacturer 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
of climbing gear -- BackDrop Climbing - they make 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
shoes. They gave me a pair of shoes, which are great

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
It's nice being sponsored.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And, um (cough)

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Excuse me.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
[Monica: We can - feel free to take a break.] Nah, it's just

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It may take a little bit more than an hour for me because - with all the water breaks

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
[Monica: Alright] Um, so that's about it. I've been sponsored by 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Mad Rock. I met Kevin Jorgeson

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
(Coughing) at the end of January

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
He was one-half of the team that climbed the Dawn Wall in Yosemite.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
You met him. I met him personally, I have a picture with him.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Well

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
it's kinda tough to tape something [Monica: Well, you know, if it's 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
okay with you maybe we can

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Put that online.] I don't own

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
[Monica: You've met him at Brooklyn Boulders?] Yes.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
[Monica: And what, what was it like?] It was nice.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Um

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I take it he's one of your...

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Oh wait, that's not going to show it. [Monica: I take it he's one of -

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
one of the climbers you, you really admire.] Yeah well,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I admire lots of people, but he's one of them.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:10.000
.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
[Monica: You'll have to share some of those photos with us.]

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:19.000
?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Here we are. [Moncia Awesome.] Yeah, awesome

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
She's really, uh, I've gotta picture of-- She's, uh

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Addidas wanted to calm her.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Er, Adidas [Monica]: Adidas. [Adam:] Yeah. All day I dream about sports

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
sports-Adidas.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Are there other ac-activities

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Activities or other sports that you are involved in?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
[Coughs.] Excuse me.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Well, I cycle.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Uh, and, um...

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I don't ride a regular bike. You may have seen me ride but I don't.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I ride the three-wheel recumbent bike. It's um real low to the ground. 

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I lean back. It's a, it's a nice bike. It doesn't go off road.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Well.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So, you've been, you've been planting for about two-and-a-half

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
years. You mention some of these awards. Um. Tell me a little bit more

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
more about what it, what that felt like, or... [Adam:] Well--

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000
What you--

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
you... if you, were you aiming to

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
to...

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
To to to/ when did this competition-- [Adam, overlapping:] I wasn't, I wasn't aiming, when it--

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
two-and-a-half years ago, I wasn't aiming to be a competitive climber.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
My competitive streak has definitely come out after I got disun--

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
--I found I was disabled. Um.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
A lot of things have come out about me after I found I was disabled.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Um.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
But now that I know that I'm competitive I enjoy winning.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I like winning. And winning the... gold medal

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
the ABS twice is a good thing. [Monica:] That's a...\ wonderful-- [Adam, overlapping:] It's a very good

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
[Monica:] --wonderful thing. [Adam, overlapping:] It's a very good thing at. Um.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Um.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Winning the Bronze in rock climbing, it's-- I swore to

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
do better. But my friend Carlos

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
. CONDIT Caffyn he could do could be

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
east is just amazing and he won the

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
gold and that there is no Again there and then kind of well

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
he's young talk much yesterday

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and he won so over and I won the bronze.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So it didn't get right him as

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
he currently changer.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Now I just came back to me. Yes we can Africa

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And go on to the

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
bar or nationalism to July. I'm going

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
to do but I don't want

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
to do the work drunk ground they're going

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
. To be

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
fun and it comes time for a week on a

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
lot that week again.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
We're going to tell me. To me

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
if not your reaction when you found out.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Who my disability had to be a little bit and then I didn't really have a

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
very action very much you have.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I knew something was wrong from

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
being what it is was doing was wrong.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And if she could have been

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
wrong with me all my life because I'm a little on methadone was one glasses

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
of wine all my life I was never

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
coordinated couldn't I could run for oh

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
no no no good.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And there are deficits they're trying to

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
overcome it. He knows where to work.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
But the reason I found out was because I was an emergency medical

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
technician in New Jersey and good region

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
squad and I. Had

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
too many times to enmeshed in this pain.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Yes it is minging when we started equating

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
that this is a pain in the ass disease.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
But then again you can't just take

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
this one.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It's not worth it

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
but it's hardly ever think after which character

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000
which is one

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
person gets sick and needs to try to prevent it asking around the

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
second or third or fourth.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
There are four and out

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
. You put the person in the chair and yet there are handles fun to

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
see the handles on the legs and if you handle nights

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
you have walked upwards.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Because if I was going backwards and snares organized to go

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
. So slow so that

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
said were basically no moving.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
This morning.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I dropped a person I was responding to a person

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
who suffers and that isn't a structure

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
dropped after heavy and

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
my has been wrong position. But it

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
looks bad because it dropped to the counseling. And

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
. Third time and we're taking a person

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
from bottom to catch and get get out from

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
behind the cat or be

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
bored. Looked it up and move with it

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and lost it.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Usman growth and fell and

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
There were five months after sounds OK me

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
on but I can't and dinners and he took me aside

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
after a call and said look it's probably nothing but you should go to

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
a doctor and get this checked out. The doctor said

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
nothing but I can't tell what it is so you

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
get that he said No no nothing. But I

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
really can't do anything more I see I

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
said today and then they came back through that and

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
said Well it's definitely something

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
sclerosis but I can't tell you what it is so

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
you see this super specialized knowledge and it's New York.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Name Paul Green so I did and who lived

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
bothers assistant asked me and took him a couple

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
hours but he asked me and I have a very

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
the rarest form of taxi or.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Twenty versions of the text. And I don't have any of

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Them and it's incurable it's just terrible for

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
me because they don't know what it is yet.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Then it's a tech Yeah but

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
those are the singers who may not be familiar with it.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Back to square one.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
OK ed text is it demented to think.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Yes yes you can get any

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
disease into a

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
G.'s back of my brain then my

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
brain can't go is getting smaller every day

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
because it just keeps going off. And it's a

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
pretty important part of your brain control for us reaches twice

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
on the way. Do. You control swallowing

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
a very important part of your brain and all your

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
brains are here for you but this is the part

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
I think in mind it's a work right

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
. GROSS If

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
I notice who is just laying

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
on Long Island Duquesne you know in due form

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
matters and a lead to a walker now I want back to fly

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
around and trying to get

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
me to use a word terror and fighting. What do

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
they know it's probably shit.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
I'm sure we'll make that decision.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Yeah it's rigged. You already have a chair. And

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
courage is that you see over there on the

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
wall are something I designed

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
called them by a bar and states that it's a cross between a right wing

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000
sick and parents home run by

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
to make for not assembly committees

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
and even if they

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
. Were tipped off it

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
has to stand with a lot of Zite and sick. See he

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
needs an ice smashed case

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
and they are well known will follow his sheep

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
. I should want to.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
So you know you told us you don't know a little bit about

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
your reaction to finding out about this but

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000
you know.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
How was it growing up and OK

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Ben Spratt in New Jersey.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Oh I wasn't in the drawl of guilt

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
for three years I have right now

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
for two years.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
TRACHTENBERG here.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
So I don't know what I could write my own but I had no

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
idea and was wrong. I know these

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
things. Zucker tell bench I

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
think that I didn't get out of

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
game play of it because those

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
unearthed and wrote poetry is

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
kids you know they were born around us after all and

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
no I don't play evil described

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
. As an

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
example I don't think save minutes is lost to me since nineteen

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
ninety one. Let me

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
thank you both so I don't think they have.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
The world and they

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Can't play. Yeah. You know us Captain arrests and

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
pain because he couldn't rest of the bird out.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Right that's rather And how

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
do you know we have a big family. You know I one brother that work

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
and he's a great guy to me. He lives in

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
D.C. his wife and daughters is very

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
different in the snow or maybe it is

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
and just suppresses it. But he works with for of

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
his good job his wife to the doctor is.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
For a filename.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
And then he drives and I

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
don't build a new law

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Or rather I say.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
How was it or how was it

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
growing up in New Jersey you know you mentioned you you're going to

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Cambridge What brought your family to Jaycee.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Well my father was born my father was a

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
nurse. Yes well I was born in Cambridge

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:29.000
trying to let you know I know

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
And down he went there to see a hairbrush Rocker's

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
universe is a lot faster. They were scared for their

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
life the rest of his life. And thirty seven years I think

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
he died sixty.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
OK

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Thank you.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
So that's why I went to go you know

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
. We lived in a very old farmhouse and

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
could see you

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
know still could come on Sundays and find this to a

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
certain ceiling of the room holding that blasts

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
and no no I don't find that day.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
But yeah.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
So it was your family pretty supportive group.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Yeah various word of me.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Oh no my brother now. But it was very very supportive

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
of me.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
They were you know you can't trust them to say oh

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
they didn't it.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:14.000
So working hard and

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
back and seeing him making the game but having him do what they

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
can get to

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
you. Know very

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
. Well for soon and so I know

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.000
well how you know in tilting it are nationalists

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
OK left. Joey you know knows the brevity.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
And so other than rock climbing leg would have been something

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
that you've enjoyed doing the writing life that we do for fun.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Well.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Like I said I was a camper for a long

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
night school we used to go to school year round. Bove would never

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
woke us live spring session and the swing

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
set and we'd have projects that we put in jail printed

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
art for all freshman and trial project you

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
had to he had to

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
make an effort in jail for a weak point or to grab

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
him but this isn't school net

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
right deal with meter so we had overnight

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
and write that for three years for

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
a fourth year. And

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
then after graduate came back as an adult for ten years

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
can work times so I

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Just thought I would give out the name.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
And artists are active cyclist

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.000

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
so are the go home there.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
You imagine generally and then there's a lot of people who want

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
To tell me about some influences in your life or

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:33.000
people that you don't want day

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Myra cloners

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
. CASM

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Jorgensen and in

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Croatia for Congress to do things that I just

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
couldn't do it would suit Boulder

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
. When you cut short her rights for roots with

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
ropes

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Sasha is just you know or a bad ass.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Oh my are similar in the Shah she was

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
twelve or thirteen. Glad she's would imagine I could ever bear

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
. And it's just like him. So I know

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
are there. In this in his book

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Brooklyn Yeah. Time to

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Crestor book and here to

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
get the previous walks to Walt I think tap

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
writers two hundred sixth Street but it's a

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
lot of fun. He found a community and definitely

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
a walk in there. Most

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
children is me but I know they're out there

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
and I asked

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
one out of Congress rather than out

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
near times. So part of us

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
and they had a kind of

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
handle. To everyone could redo it a CD.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
And when I was with Alvin the man and the hands

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
away from me on board

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
. And I don't know about

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
his blog in fact I'm in there right now.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
So yeah it's a good thing.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Could community they support you they get this

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
rotten buggers who could see

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.000
a bugger to fund a fund of mining

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
bloat. Oh good to be here

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
for our work.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
And John lefty sort of blew my

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000
cage which is great.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
And we'll become friends over here

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.000
What is your process to what is your problem. Process

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
I do have a rock

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
but I had an appointee have to have a list

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
yet but this is driven by head to

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
head.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
That's rich. I

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
warned them that they

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
want revolve around them. But there are various critics we are

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
all forced you know. And. So

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
I took up the roots a little bit eating lunch strategy

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
John.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Well it is

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
said to now I can't go on

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
The use you use and you can prove you are

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
going to be fired. Why

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000
.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Is this

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
that this is such

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
A. C.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
work.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Do you

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Want. To try

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000
to swerve current.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
But Burton worker's book

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.000
is

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:20.000
.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Mind over matter and pain taxi and ask.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Yes to evade my cage match. Column and asked how it would be

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
where one person who's come to Iraq.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
And talk to you you were a half head to head

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
I say I'm going to read I

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Mean read a claim is the most important thing to

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
me Ed and Elaine claim we are and we ask and this exact

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
one and pay attention and stop looking at my hands and really you know

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
down to him to reach an understanding.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Supposed to look at us. What else am I supposed to

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
do. Yeah well.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
So anyone can check. Why take it

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
so well.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
What changed will change for you or for others

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
. You know when you started your journey you know

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
greasing your disability and

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
. You know really

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
just living living with that.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Well I was too gracefully. Oh

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.000
yeah

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:07.000
.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Oh God.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
I have no choice but to leave because

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
it's a part of me it's a big part of me it's not all thing

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
that is not disabled.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Remember. Oh but a friend of mine named dresses

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
that is one of the good skier. And he

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.000
says I don't think of myself but it's a long

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
brown nose

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
I don't think of myself as disabled and I don't think of myself as disabled

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
that.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
I mean yes I know I am, but I

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Didn't mean doesn't mean, oh I enjoy doing things that people don't think

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
will do which includes rock climbing, includes

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
walking around the snow. Falling on the bus

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
which I did, which I did quite often, I did it last night

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
. Actually

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
um

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
The bus driver?, Oh my God can I help you off the bus, no

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Oh OK I got it?, but I didn't fall I hit the wall

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
So yes, but I just love doing things that people don't think I

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
think I can do. And you've really succeeded

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.000
.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
They say Oh I'm not done yet. Hopefully

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000
What's on the pipeline. Well there is a next world

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
t?. Paris in 2016 and I have to get a

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000
medal at the paraclimbing championships and ah try

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000
? sixteen.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
And that's one thing I have to nail

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
and I'm just gonna keep being a

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000
bad ass. Which is something I say

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
say?

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
I can't stop and I don't want to give

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
up biking so I'm going do a ride down into Staten Island

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
summer, to where, Staten Island I want to go all the way down

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
hit bottom ten percent

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
?. what the beaches are like down there. So I don't know.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
And I swear that it's about an 80 ride, round trip

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000
I've got this one friend interested, I have to actually plan it

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
in the Staten Island trip.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Yeah actually but

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
?.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Be done. It can't, I'm sure it has been done ?

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
also I want to get, I don't know what

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
is ?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
re up with them, so I'm continuing to follow new pathways

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
to sponsorship, see if maybe ?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
? to be interested in me.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Like our paraclimbers maybe that's

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
we ah put the industry in a good light

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000
?

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
So sometimes I feel like capitalising that way too much

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
but if they're willing to give me the money I'm willing to do the work

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
and for our listeners who might not be familiar with paraclimbing or

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000
climbing

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
what are the, what's the distinction

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Well paraclimbing is a disabled climb, uh a lot of my

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000
friends are missing limbs.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
One of my friends who won the gold at the world, she had a

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
caught in a building in the earthquake in Haiti to the knee

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
another one of my friends that won the gold

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
was born without a hand.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
But really did climbing and they were climbing for

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:04.000
longer then I have been. Um I

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.000
another friend is, lots of friends

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
like Ron is missing pretty much

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
his entire left leg and he's, he can be doing the ABS

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
procomp with the able bodied athletes, he didn't go 

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
very hard but he competed.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
? picture of him doing the bat hang

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
After a while

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Bat hanging? upside down hanging by the tips of his feet. One

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
them is an artificial prosthetic, which I

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000
tearing it off.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
But he didn't

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
um. It's a very impressive community. Yeah we

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.000
all know each other pretty well.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
There aren't that many disabled paraclimbers, so we're a

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
pretty small community and as they're good, know each other

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
And so you you have this supportive

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
community you're you're um hoping to plan this trip to Staten

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Island so New York is, New York is your stomping

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
ground,  tell

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
New York is home base. Tell me what it's like to be in New

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
York or tell me about that identity

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
I really don't have a New York ? I've given the subway

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
to book ? hands a week.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Um in the summer I ride my bike a lot around New York

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
also I've done New Jersey riding over the George Washington bridge

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
near New Jersey so I've done that then, that's our

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
say I've ridden around there.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
New York is just a place to a hang a hat, it's where I live.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000
I love it because it has a subway ? bus

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
good um if I went to

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
car and since I don't know how to drive ?

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
too difficult. I can get a car but

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
I do want to try to get

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000
again if I don't get a car which is not

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
something in New York at least I can rent one if I need to go somewhere

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
biking distance.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And and you mention that

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
You you've got your eye on that Paris prize right.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Yes definitely, very definitely

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
?

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000
last year, um

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000
I really want to get to fountain blue

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
outside of Paris, I don't know how far outside of Paris but

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
in Spain we rented a car so we spent time

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
? so I begged to see if maybe we can take a week

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
have some climbing areas maybe dry run ? a little bit

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
that'd be fun, and I also want to ? climb so that I can

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
become better at this stuff.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.000
You wanna learn how to, ? climb

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
? climbing space, we call it being at the sharp end of the rope

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:16.000
tightened to the rope, you're at the very end of it

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
think it's if your ? broke ? you have rope ? harness up into the

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
? and down into a ? So you can fall with impunity

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
you don't lose anything. If you're leaning you can fall but you can

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
fall upto about to twenty feet, depending on where you

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
are. And it's a skill it's not easy to learn, I learned the

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
hard way is that it ? fell and

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
I almost hit the ground.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
the Go-pro on my head did hit the ground

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
and it fell off. I was upside down

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
but I was okay ?

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000
One bad

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000
I was unhurt

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Even though my friend Marie who's rope I was using kinda

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
laughed at me ? to rope.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Did you replace it, no she replaced it, I didn't

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
No! Ropes are expensive and one

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:31.000
fall wouldn't have done it. ? a lot that week

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
so. This was in Spain in ?

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
ropes at their practice gym

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
so we used her rope for that, so a lot of people fall

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
It wasn't just me so I wouldn't have replaced it, I may replace

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
And she knows that, that's why she was joking around. You have a 

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
great sense of humor you, thank you, you

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
um

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Well if you can't laugh about what makes you ill what can you do

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
I don't want to cry about it. I've seen people who cried about their illness

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
and it's just not any fun

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
and people who don't ? apartments

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.000
What do you want to tell people like that, or what's your

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
message, my message is well

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
The message of the climbing group is anyone can climb

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
um

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
where as my favourite quote is um

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
? sometimes courage is ? at the end of the day

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:05.000
they think we'll try again tomorrow, so I guess ?

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
? to suceed try and try again ?

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
like that I guess that's my message. And try try

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000
again has worked for me.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:26.000
How did you... How did you

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
did you cope. You know when you 

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000
some of your first failures, some of your first challenge, some of your first challenges, Well

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000
for the first two years that I had

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
this... That I knew I had this disease

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
um

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000
I, I was awful.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
?

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000
I didn't know how to react. I was apologising to people for things that I

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
couldn't control. You know sending drunken telephone

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
thing. No I'm not joking or getting very defensive about it.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
after a while I just sat there ? it's not worth it.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000
You can only be angry for so long until you just get tired of it

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000
What made you change your perspective.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000
I don't know, I think it's just the way I am, it helps a lot going on in my life

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
good things going on and I had good friends. I was in New Jersey at the time

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Wasn't ?.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
um I was ? 1997 so

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Long time. Ago um

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
But for the first two years I was still hiking, I was still

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
volunteering with the same ?

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000
just trying to live my life and you know living my life seemed like a pretty good deal

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:06.000
for me, so that was it. And you've been

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000
doing it since, I have been and it's a pretty good deal for me

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
What do you want to tell, what do you want to tell

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:24.000
people, people who don't, who haven't

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000
experienced what you have, just try it, just try it

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000
it's worth it, it

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.000
feels very good, even if you don't suceed it feels good and

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000
also exercise will help your disease.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.000
I had a friend once

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000
who had heard from her doctor that she should not exercise with her ?

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000
cause it would be bad for her and I didn't agree with it

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:57.000
? I think she's dead. I haven't talked to her in years.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
But she was, she just did nothing. She didn't

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
got things from her and people get things from me too sometimes. Like the

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
water, thank you.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
But um

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000
um.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:22.000
I do that for me because I want to. They did that for her, well they wanted to

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000
?

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
I think if you just try, you'll surprise

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.000
yourself. And at present

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000
yourself and it's surprising that it like I've said it before feels very good

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.000
I don't know that's about all I can say

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000
getting this right

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Every ?, Yeah yeah thank you for sharing that

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:54.000
.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Is there something else you want to tell, you know tell

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.000
listeners or tell people in the disability community or

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000
what are, what are some last words you want to share

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
It's a final thought

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000
um

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Toughest question, it is a tough question.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000
?

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000
.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000
I hate to say it but I really don't have anything else

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:40.000
to say, I've pretty much said what I wanted to say.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
I, well I do,

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000
I want to add that

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me, I feel l'll probably have

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.000
some questions ?

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
? after that, I think I think I might actually

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000
I've been meaning to head over to Brooklyn boulders

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:13.000
because the I actually visited the won

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.000
they opened in Chicago, oh you did. I've wanted, how is that gym, I've wanted to

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:22.000
visit there for a long time, it was, that was my

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:27.000
first climbing experience, they also have one they've got

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
? Well it just

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.000
was ? big, yeah I don't think it they were that high in

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Chicago, no they're 50 feet I think. 26 foot

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000
was really ? size small there and what I liked is

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000
in Georgia last year for the nationals

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:56.000
60-80 foot walls, they were huge

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000
and they were just so much fun, I would say

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
I that it was so much fun when I went there and I took my eighteen year

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.000
old brother who's on the autism spectrum

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
mmm, and ah

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.000
He, he was so happy and so excited

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:23.000
to be there and listening to you.

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.000
I've found that cause we do outreach programs ?

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
like we climb with the group

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Pediatrics two times a year I think and it's

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:42.000
great fun. Watch 2 and 3 year olds getting up the wall and they're having a great time

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
we're having a great time

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000
and um

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.000
that's why I do what I do, I remeber one of my friends Doug

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.000
put a poster for his work.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Where he was ? this little kid out the wall and then just ?

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.000
everything is all right with my world and that's the way you feel

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:11.000
the world. It's empowering.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000
So where does your brother live, He lives in Chicago, ah because I was going

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000
to say on Thursday's

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000
at 6 o'clock and ah we'd be happy to climb with him

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.000
you know what, I I'm thinking about bringing him to New York this summer so I think

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
