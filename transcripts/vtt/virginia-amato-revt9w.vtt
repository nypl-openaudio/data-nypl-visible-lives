00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Today February 27th, 2015 and I'm going to interview

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Virginia Amato.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Hello, Virginia. Tell me what makes you different from other individuals

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What makes me different from other individuals is I suffer from bipolar

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
disorder and some people

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
don't understand what that is. But me I hear

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
voices. I see things that normal people

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
don't see and

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that's, um

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
basically

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
my outlook on life right now is that I'm trying to cope with

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
My disability and educating people about it too

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Do you live

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
at home. Yes I do. What do you like about yourself.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I like about myself is that I'm

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
a caring, loving, sweet person. I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
have a wonderful family that's behind me and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
[pause]

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I enjoy life. What do you dislike about yourself.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I dislike about myself uh my ability to want to eat a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
lot of food and just

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
[pause]

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Trying hard not to do that because I don't want to go back to the weight that I used to be

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So you must have worked very hard on that. Yes, I worked very hard.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I had the lap band surgery and it was a long struggle to get to where I am now

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Let me ask you do you consider your life difficult?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
No, not really. Not really. I don't consider my life difficult I consider that I

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
have a great life.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Can I ask you who has been the most important person in your life? My mother.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Can you tell me what the most important lesson you've learned from your

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Mom?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The most important lesson I learned from my mom is she is a

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
kind, sweet person that has taught me that even though I have a

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
disability I am as normal as any other person out there.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
there. (repeated in tool, not in actual story)

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I have a quote from a poet.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Tell me what person did you, Virginia Amato, decide to be?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Me, myself, and I that's who I decided to be.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I want you to finish this sentence for me. I draw my strength from ___

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
My family.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Because without them in my life I would just

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
be another person probably locked away in an insane asylum somewhere

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
just being mistreated because of a disability that people don't understand

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Thank you, Virginia, your story is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I'm honored that you shared it with me. You're welcome. It's going to forever be preserved

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
. Thank you.
