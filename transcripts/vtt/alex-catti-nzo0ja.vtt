00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello my name is Alexandria Economou and I'm going to have a conversation

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with Alex Catti for Visible Lives An Oral History Project at

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the New York Public Library.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It is February 8th, 2015

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and this is being recorded in my home: Mountaintown, New York.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Hi, Alex.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Hi.  

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Can tell you a bit about where you grew up? Sure, I grew up in a suburban town in New York.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
New York. It was a very Irish population. And me, being Italian, felt a little

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
bit out of place. But, uh, that was a nice place. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
[Hard cut, missing audio.]--primarily upper middle class. Um. And

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
town of about fifteen thousand people.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
[Inaudible.]

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
You remember your first encounter or earliest encounter with somebody who

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
had some kind of disability? Yes.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Yes. There was a student in one of my classes in elementary school, and I

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
believe he had cerebral palsy. Um. But he always was very

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
very well liked. He had friends in school. Um. And

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
he always seemed to be having a good time. I mean, we all hung out together.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
How did that make you feel? [Alex:] It was good to see that our class

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
classmates accepted him, and didn't treat him differently just because he had

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
um, a disability that made him, um, 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
like act differently from us, uh-a-and I-don't-mean act differently in a physical way. But it didn't

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
change the fact that people still wanted to talk to him. They wanted to be friends with him. So I

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
was happy to see that. That's good.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So, in high school, you had a friend that had a kidney transplant and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
somebody who was going through something quite different. Um. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You weren't put off in any way.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Why is that? Because I realize that everybody, including myself

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
has certain struggles that we have to face in our lives, and there's

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
nothing to say that one person's struggle is better or

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
worse, more uncomfortable than someone else's. It's just things that they have to deal with but

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
it doesn't make them a different person.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And then.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
That friend introduced you to somebody else who had a transplant. Me.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And, how did we even become friends?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I remember that I think she introduced us on AIM when AIM was

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
popular. [Alex laughs in the background: "Oh, yeah!") So I find that funny how it's changed since then

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But I remember we were talking, and maybe it was a snow day or something and we just kept talking online

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and we just became friends that way. And then, I think the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
first time we came, we hung out, was when he came to see one of the plays that I was working on.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Yeah, I remember that. So because of lovely

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
technology our friendship started. Yeah.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Yup. Exactly.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We've been friends for about seven years, but it feels so much longer.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I think because you never judged me.  

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
You know, I mean, you made me feel okay. What's your take on it? I

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I didn't judge you because I don't, I never saw you any differently than I saw

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.000
anybody else.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I mean, we're all people. So I'm happy that our friendship started

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
so strong and it's lasted for this time. And you're right! It does feel longer because we've

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
been through so much. High school. College! [Alexandria:] Yeah, and other things! [Alex:] Yeah, and we've

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
seen so many, many shows [Yeah] and done a lot

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
[Room tone.]

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Do you ever feel uncomfortable? Or, like, you didn't know the right thing to say to

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.000
me?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
(Slight pause.) No. I think I always,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I've always known what to say. I mean, you just talk to your friends...

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that's just it. You just talk to your friends. And, um. Sometimes it's hard to

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
think of what to say to people in general. Like, if people are going through a bad break up, or there's something

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
you know that they need help with. Sometimes you don't know how to console them if you've never been

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
through it before. But sometimes there's not much you can do other than just listen to them

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and hear them out when they're stressed, and be there for them if they if they need your

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
support.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Yes I agree.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Like, you know, here's a good example. When I was having -  going to have - 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
another surgery.  How did that make you feel.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I was worried for you but I knew that you've been, you were strong,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
strong. You are strong and that you weren't going to have a problem getting through it because you've gotten through

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
everything up until that point. [Alexandria:] Yes. (Sound of pages turning.)

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
(Silence.)

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Were you scared with me? I think a little bit, but I didn't know... I

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
think it's a different kind of scared because you don't know what it feels like to

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
be the person going through it. You can only see it from an outside lens.  

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So you hope that everything is going to go well but it's not your

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
own. Um. It's not your own experience.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So it's a little bit different.  But even though it wasn't your own experience

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
you lived it vicariously through me and... Yes.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
For sure. And how did that feel?  I remember, I think you were, it was either

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
before you went in, or whatnot, you had said that you were kind of nervous and that your

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
mom was like trying to calm you down or whatever and I just remember thinking I couldn't imagine

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
what I would be like. I'd probably be doing the same thing. Freaking out, like oh my gosh ,I don't know if I can

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
do this, but, um.  Yeah, I don't know, I just

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I think that one moment kind of put it in perspective for me because I figured I'd be acting the

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
same way that were so...Wow 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
OK. So you know, I never really thought of this

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
this way but, I guess, you know, for our friendship to continue

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
you had to come to terms with the fact that, you know, I

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
am disabled. I have medical stuff and this was kind of my existence.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Um.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
What do you think, or how did that make you feel? I mean, it didn't make me

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
feel anything different.  We still do things that everybody else 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
everybody else would do as two friends.  It's just that maybe I'll be the one driving all the time and you might not

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
be but you know, that's OK. [Laughs. ]We work around the things that you might have a little bit

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
more difficulty doing and we get, we do, whatever we want to do anyway.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Yeah. Yeah, that is true. Sometimes you have to be creative. Yeah.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I always felt that you had empathy towards me.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I've seen you have it with others. Are you aware this? I guess

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
At a subconcious level I'm aware of it.  I think it's because like I was saying before 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
before, we all have struggles that we're dealing with and I know that I have my own

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
personal things that I am trying to work through, and sometimes still am trying to work through. So

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
even if I'm not going through the same thing as someone else, even if it's something completely different that I've never had to deal with,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I understand that it might be tough for that person and that maybe they need

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
someone to... to be their friend and to listen to them and

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
sometimes that listening, it helps. It helps for people to vent, and it helps for people to

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
to know that someone does care even if they don't, um, have that same exact

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
experience.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Yes.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Given all that you know about my medical condition. What

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
has surprised you about me? 

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
 I think you are... Resiliency. When there's a

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
problem the way that you're able to, you're able to go to the

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
doctor and, and get all these shots and whatnot. It doesn't faze you.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
. But also just the way they never let it stop you from doing what you want and you work

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
on your ceramics and I think that's really cool. So not a lot of people do that. You never let it stop you from

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
being creative in trying to work in the theater. You graduated college.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Like all these things that people, I think, don't really realize that people with a

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
disability are a hundred percent capable of doing - more than a hundred percent capable of doing  - and I

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
think that before we were friends I never really thought about it.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
But then after seeing all you can do I realized, like, anybody can do anything.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
You can. You really can.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Are you able to learn from somebody who has to do things so differently from yourself? 

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Yes, and I think as a teacher, which is what I do,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
that you have to be open to learning to how, learning how other

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
people do things because you can, you can see a lot

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
of different perspectives and maybe it'll give you some idea on how to manage something in

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
your own life.  Maybe in a way you've never thought of before.  Maybe you'll see a new perspective 

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
never thought of before. So. We have to we have to learn from others. Otherwise we would

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
be closed off and we wouldn't really go anywhere as individuals or as a society. 

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000
I think,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
You know, life in general is a whole learning experience. Absolutely. I

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
believe that we're learning from the time we're born until the time we die. Yes.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Has knowing me changed your perspective on

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
disability? In any particular way?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
I guess any perceptions you had before knowing me 

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
in the years that you have known me?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Yeah, I think that, like I was saying a couple minutes ago, that I never

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
really thought about people with disabilities. Um, it, you know,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
very explicitly. Except maybe that one classmate that I

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.000
that I was with. But he never let anything stop him from doing

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
anything and when I saw him making friends and running around the track with the rest of us

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
even though it was a little bit harder for him, I've said or realized that anybody can do anything, and then when

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
we became friends I didn't really question it. I didn't really think that maybe there were things

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
that you couldn't do or, or weren't capable of doing because really you don't let things

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
get you down. So, I guess I saw that disability... maybe it

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
makes things more difficult in one way but it doesn't stop people from being who they are

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and getting things done that they want to do.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
You know, just sometimes I may have to do it in a different way just doesn't mean I can't.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Exactly.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Just I have to find a different way.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Do you ever feel compelled to help somebody with an obvious disability because

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
you know me?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Yes, and I don't know if it's because I know you or maybe it's just my 

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
nature, but in one of my jobs, we have patrons that come into the

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
theater and sometimes they're in wheelchairs or they have walkers or canes

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and you know, I... it's just knowing that they need someone to

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
to maybe clear the path for them and get them down to their stage level seating. It's little

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
things and they they really do appreciate it when someone understands that maybe they need a little

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
bit of extra help. And then as a teacher I have some students who have

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
some, um, you know, IEPs.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And again, it's just knowing that... having some, um.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
What kind of modifications they need, and just helping them. And they really appreciate it. You can see how... how

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
well they do once you  take the time out to... to make the appropriate modifications.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
So just giving someone that little extra hand goes a long way. So do you

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
feel or notice that you actually go out of your way to help

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
people that you know have an obvious disability?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
I... I don't really consider it going out of my way. I would just consider it being

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
a good person doing the right thing. I think going out of your way implies

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
that it's a bother, a burden. Which it shouldn't be. We should just help each

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
other. That's the way it's supposed to be. Then maybe I said that the wrong way and

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Please edit this out maybe.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Not even that you go out of your way. You know, just, you have that whole, that

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
feeling that you want to help more.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Oh. Yes. I think so. Because I want to make...I want to make

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
someone's day enjoyable. I want someone to realize that there

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
are good people out there. Because a lot of the time I think people will turn a blind eye and I definitely don't want to

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
be that person, because, hey, we're all people and you never know what's going to happen to you in

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:38.000
your life and you want to make someone else enjoy themselves and

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
you want them to have a good experience because you hope someone would do the same for you.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So true and

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
You know. What disability they they truly know when you're

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
being sincere or you're faking it you know you've always been sincere

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
thank you. I think also you're OK to help

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
other people in this case of no meat you feel like an insider

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Yes and you get you get it you just get it.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Yeah because even those people that have different abilities it's just knowing that sometimes you have

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
to get over it.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So if you have personal experiences with

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
people who have had difficult journeys

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
what would you want what would you say on their behalf to the world outside of the

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
civility and I would say don't judge.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And that might sound really obvious but it's true because

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
they just fear that a lot of people have is the judgment of others

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
. And what will people say and what are they going to think and that's really a

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
paralyzing fear for a lot of people that I've seen but the strongest people are the ones

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that say you know what people are going to judge me and I can't do anything about it so I'm just going to do what I

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.000
need to do and move on. But the thing is it's sad that it

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
has to be like that and it's sad that people will always judge

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
I should say will be judged hopefully it'll change but people do judge so harshly.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
So I think my biggest message to the people who

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
don't necessarily deal with disability is. I

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
don't I don't judge really. Because you don't know how much you can you can

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
hurt someone without even realizing it.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And Alex for my final question. Any words of wisdom

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I would say try as as a person in

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
society just try to learn from others and

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
hear other people's stories and hear their experiences because that will give

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
you such a good well rounded view of

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
what life is like for not only yourself the people that you're close to but you learn

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
so many other things and maybe from learning something else you'll get to meet new people and make new

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
friends that you never thought you would have. For I know that from working in search in different

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
jobs and and taking on different interests I met friends from all different walks

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and I think that that's so interesting and so fun because

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
life isn't black and white there are so many different things in between

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
. So you should try to learn as much as you can as

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I tend to say I would agree. I don't really know about the black and

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000
white.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
That's true. Yeah. So that's what I would say is that

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
the best thing to do and just as a general thing you know it's

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
good in.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
That it is the end of our conversation. Thank you so much, Alex. Thanks for having me.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:57.000
me.
